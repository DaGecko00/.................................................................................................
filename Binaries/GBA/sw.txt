=======================================================================
Hi there, how are you doing? My name is Allen and this is my walkthrough for Vytron's Pokemon Sors game, welcome to it :) Sors is one of those titles that I've known of but only based on the features list, screenshots I've seen and comments I have read from people as they play the game. I didn't know that it is part of a series, following after Vytron's other game Pokemon Saiph and when I found out about that, I was eager to do a walkthrough for Saiph first. But there isn't any documentation for the game (and Vytron is currently working on a sequel to Saiph AND apparently the first Saiph could be remade down the road) so I decided to skip over to Sors for the time being and perhaps someday I will work on a Saiph walkthrough when the documentation for it is available. With all that out of the way, let's get started!

The game begins with narration from an unknown character who claims that they are not an ordinary kid and they were not born into an ordinary family, because their parents were the leaders of the Siarra Mafia in Hupest, the main region. Power, influence, control, they had it all. Then our narrator was born, a boy named Asher whom the parents wanted to be a future leader of the organisation. But Mom and Dad's relationship soured as time went on because of differences they had when it concerned a major science project that they were working on. Dad thought it was too dangerous while Mom continued with the project. Eventually they divorced and Asher grew up under his father who left Siarra, while his mother gained full control of the organisation. Dad still aims to take down Siarra but doesn't want to involve Asher. The game then asks players what they think about destiny, with 2 answers available as options: 

> It depends on your actions.
> You can't change it!

No idea if this is a story-changing question or just a question for you to see the different responses so you can choose whichever answer you like. In the end Asher vows to prove that life isn't as straighforward as some people think it is and then we shift to the next scene.

We see a house in a place called Inizio Isle, this is the home of Asher and Dad. Dad wakes him up and tells Asher to come downstairs to catch a broadcast of an interview of Mrs. Ivo, someone that Asher met when he was younger. Once Dad leaves the room we are shown the Options screen and after you're done scroll down to Cancel and get out of bed. I was playing Pokemon Unbound a few months ago so this has just brought that vibe flooding back to me haha, I press START expecting to see information at the bottom of my screen about what to do next but instead I see the regular descriptions of the main menu options :) you'll notice that Asher is already running, you can switch between running and walking by pressing L. The PC just shows a Town Map but it's nice to get an early look at the towns and cities of Hupest

Downstairs we'll see the entrance to Dad's room but Asher isn't allowed in there. The broadcast starts and we are introduced to Hupest's resident Pokemon Professor Mrs. Ivo. Pokemon and the people of Hupest have lived together in harmony for 300 years now and to celebrate this there will be a special international event taking place known as the Eclipse Tournament. Trainers don't have to collect Gym Badges in order to participate, they have to head over to Hupest's capital Amor City and register for the tournament at the Amor Sports Center. Registration is in 3 days' time and then the tournament begins 15 days later. Nothing like a major tournament announcement to get you fired up, eh? That should be awesome :)

After the broadcast ends Dad receives a message from Ivo, she hopes Asher watched it and that he'll be in the tournament. We learn that Dad doesn't like Pokemon battles but he doesn't tell Asher why. Hmm. Asher is eager to take part in the event and so tomorrow he and Dad will leave for Lancio Town, where Ivo's lab is located. For now though it is time for bed so head upstairs and hit the sack.

The next day Asher wakes up to find a wrapped package in his room, although it isn't his birthday. Dad comes up, it turns out that the gift is from him. Inside the package is a HuPhone. Dad says he'll wait for Asher at the dock, a friend of his will take them to Lancio Town. Quite the handy device that this HuPhone is: it gives us access to the PC Item Storage (there's a Potion waiting to be taken), it has a World Map and the Quest Log. It looks like all the Quests are already listed there. What was I saying about Unbound vibes earlier, huh? My hope is the Quests in this game aren't mostly boring filler and that they're interesting and worthwhile missions. Head downstairs and leave the house. A nice nod to Regular Show by the TV :)

Once outside, turn left and check that tuft of grass on the cliff for a hidden Oran Berry. Go to the right side cliff, you'll find a hidden TinyMushroom (see screenshot) then see Dad and his friend Harry at the dock. We'll catch the last bit of the conversation between them before Dad introduces Asher: Harry says to Dad that things are going to get complicated again. What could he be talking about? Dad tells Harry where they're headed and why, no problem for Harry, and off we go. During the trip Asher spends some time to think about the journey he is about to start and wonders if things are going to start happening too. You never know :)

We finally arrive in Lancio. Dad shows Asher the Lab where Prof. Ivo will give him his very first Pokemon. Harry suddenly receives a phonecall and it's bad news, even Dad won't tell Asher what has happened but confirms that it is work-related and leaves with Harry. Asher is left to wonder if it involves Siara. Once you can move, check the patch of grass on the upper left for a hidden Awakening (or see screenshot). There's also a hidden Chesto Berry on the north end of the mini path behind the town signboard (see screenshot). The man living in the house next to the Lab gives us our very first TM just to get rid of us haha TM17 Protect. 

IVO'S POKEMON LABORATORY
------------------------

It seems like nobody is here at first but there she is, Prof. Ivo. She's surprised to see that this is the same Asher from years ago :) Asher tells her about Dad having to leave to solve a problem but he'll join them later. Ivo has a Pokemon that she has chosen to be Asher's Starter: 

RIOLU - The Emanation Pokemon
Level: 5
Type: Fighting
Ability: Quick Feet
Moves: Tackle, Quick Attack, Growl

Interesting choice, Professor. No PokeDex though. After that she gives Asher 5 Poke Balls, 1 Potion and a Torn Scarf which was found with Riolu. As Asher puts it on Riolu he notes how familiar it looks and here comes a brief flashback...

			    5 Years Ago... 

In a forest somewhere we'll see little Asher find an injured Riolu and he tries to help it with his scarf. Well well.

Back to the present, exit the Lab and find Dad outside. He's back but with more bad news - Mom and her crew are back! They haven't done anything terrible yet but Dad tells Asher that they'll worry about that later. He wishes Asher good luck for his journey and goes into the Lab to see Ivo. So begins the journey, you can enter the Pokemon Center now and hit the Mart for supplies before going east out of town.

Just before stepping off the dust road into the grass, there's a gap between the trees up top. You'll find a hidden Oran Berry there (see screenshot). Although we don't have a PokeDex yet you can catch Pokemon, many thanks to Raptor from the Discord for letting me know about this. Catch a spare Bidoof, someone will want to trade their Froakie for a Bibarel. Continue on to find a Trainer Tips signpost, just northeast from it, out of the grass, is a hidden Cheri Berry (see screenshot). We'll also find a Youngster with a dialogue bubble over his head, speak to him and find out that his Pidgey has wandered off somewhere on this route. If you would like to help him accept the Quest. The game will then give a brief explanation about the Side Quest system. To cancel the Quest speak to the Youngster again. Be aware that you can't have multiple Quests going on, you must cancel an active Quest before you can accept a new one. 

[q01] Lost Pidgey 

Southeast from the Youngster is a hidden Stardust by the edge of the water (or see screenshot). Go north to find a house occupied by a Bug Catcher who'll give us a Max Repel. If you go behind the house you'll see a Pidgey running circles in the grass above. There it is, we'll have to circle round to reach it. Head northwest from the house to meet our very first Trainer opponents Mike and then Sonia.

Youngster Mike
- Lv5 Rattata [Normal]
Prize: P260

Lass Sonia
- Lv5 Cherubi [Grass]
Prize: P320

Northeast from her is a hidden Pecha Berry (see screenshot) and Duke a few steps ahead. 

Bug Catcher Duke
- Lv6 Burmy [Bug]
Prize: P312

Past him is the entrance to Sovio City, but leave it for now and go down to pick up Pidgey. Just above the ledge on the left is a hidden Repel. Return Pidgey to the Youngster and be rewarded with a Timer Ball. If you accepted this Quest then congratulations for completing your very first one :) now let's step into Sovio City shall we?

Don't worry about the 3 Bikers that you'll see as we arrive in town, they're part of the urban scenery. The real drama starts when you head east: Asher sees his dad Jackson confronting Mom and a pair of her subordinates! Mom says the organisation has completed the big project that we heard about earlier, this time we get its name - The Eclipse Project. Asher enters the scene, surprising his parents. Mom is pleased to see him but Jackson won't let her get too close to Asher. Mom then shifts back to the business at hand and her Grunts let out a pair of Pidgey. Jackson notices that there is something different about them. A girl from the crowd tries to defuse the situation but the Grunts send the Pidgey to attack her. This is too much for Asher and he steps up to face Mom, who commands the Grunts to fight him. We'll just facing one of them.

Siara Grunt
- Lv7 E. Pidgey [Flying/Eclipsed]
Prize: P728

**BATTLE NOTES:
- Looks like in this form Pidgey is just a Flying-type. 

I saw Eclipsing listed among the Features of this game and wondered what that could be. Well, we've had a taste of it now. Mom is satisfied with the test subjects even though the battle was lost. She and the Grunts leave, Asher checks on the girl and she's okay. After the crowd disperses Jackson and Asher discuss what has happened concerning the modified Pidgey. Jackson is worried that more powerful Pokemon will be targeted next and this could be for weaponisation. He wants Asher to focus on his journey, he'll deal with Mom. Jackson says Asher should meet up with him at the Metro Station. Once he leaves we can have a look around before moving forward.

The Name Rater's house is southwest from the city center pond. South of the pond is a hidden Black Sludge (see screenshot). The old man near the Pokemon Center offers the "Lost Toy" Quest, which is about searching for his Machop's favourite toy in the Sovio Sewers. 

[q02] Lost Toy

The entrance to the Metro Station is just below the old man. 

SOVIO METRO STATION
-------------------

We see Jackson and he tells Asher that they are headed for Amor City now. Asher hasn't forgotten about what happened earlier but Jackson assures him that he'll handle that matter. As they are about to leave, that girl from before shows up. She heard about the tournament and wants to qualify for it. After not being able to fight back earlier she is determined to get stronger and not be helpless again. Her name is Valora. Asher seems to like her but then wonders if she counts as competition now since she is also aiming for the tournament. Jackson doesn't mind if Valora travels with them and so the three of them prepare to leave when there's a sudden noise. Jackson goes to investigate and Asher doesn't want to stand by without helping. Valora decides she wants to come along too and you have a choice to make, either you turn her down or not. Doesn't matter which answer you choose, the result is the same - Valora has her own Pokemon and Asher agrees to let her come along. Go through that south entrance.

After Asher joins up with Valora the scene shifts elsewhere in the sewers: we see a squad of Siara Grunts standing outside a storage room. One of them has managed to lock Jackson in there. Even though he threatens them if they don't release him, the Grunts ignore him and continue their operation. One Grunt stays to guard the room while the others go off to patrol. 

Go down the stairs and head left to find a Grunt. She stops Asher and tells him to move along, but Asher decides play it cool and tells her about Jackson going missing. Just as the Grunt starts to feel sorry for him, Jackson is heard from a distance calling for help and it's battle time.

Siara Grunt
- Lv6 Hippopotas [Ground]
- Lv7 E. Pidgey [Flying/Eclipsed]

Grunt #6 is the one guarding the storage room, she stops Asher halfway before he can reach it. Suddenly the Grunt receives a phonecall from her boss and is told that all the Grunts can leave now. After the Grunts are gone, go to the storage room entrance and rescue Jackson. As you would expect, he's more surprised to see Asher and Valora here than thank him for the help xD. Asher tells him what happened and about hearing the Grunts mention a "young master" who is looking for something. Jackson says they should discuss this after leaving the sewers. He goes on ahead, Asher and Valora start to leave too until Asher stops by the corridor halfway to the storage room. He tells Valora to go on, he wants to confirm if this young master is still here somewhere. Go up to descend the staircase at the end of the corridor.

**NOTE:
- Stunfisk can be found here too. 

This is where Flash is needed :S damn...and we're still in the sewers, double damn. A few steps to the left and you'll see stairs heading up, they lead to a Nugget. Continue going left to find an entrance, it leads to a small room occupied by the Lost Toy, nice. Leave the room, back to the stairs we saw before and turn south to descend the next stairs. Go south until you reach a second breakable rock, it'll be on your right. If you turn and go left from there you'll find an entrance below you. There's another entrance in the southeast corner from that breakable rock as well. Ignore the first entrance. The second one takes us to the "young master" Asher heard about. He has found what he was looking for and now something else that he's got is complete. He hopes it works and that his boss will be pleased. When Asher tries to confirm if he's the young master, this guy isn't happy to see him. Asher decides not to reveal his connection to Siara and just says he's here for a friend. The guy doesn't have kind words for friends and he thinks Asher knows too much, so he defeats him in a battle that happens super fast. Before the guy leaves, Asher asks for his name, the Gible that he has and what exactly did he find. His name is Frio, all he has to say about Gible is Eclipsing and whatever he found here Asher wouldn't understand. Harsh. Who is this guy anyway?

Return to the Metro Station, if you accepted the "Lost Toy" Quest then return the item to the old man and he'll reward you with a Black Belt. Back at the Station Asher tells Jackson about meeting Frio and now he wants answers about Eclipsing and whatever Frio completed. Jackson says he'll explain everything on the way to Amor City. They board the train, find some seats and cue that flashback...

While Jackson was still part of Siara he and Mom Marie worked on a major project. It had to do with the Eternal Eclipse, an event from 300 years ago that people thought to be a myth. But it did happen, an event which was documented as a Lunar Eclipse that was followed by a Solar Eclipse. This resulted in Pokemon transforming, becoming unstable and violent and the Siara crew succeeded in replicating this with good old science (Eclipsing). But not every Pokemon could handle this and Jackson eventually realised how terrible Eclipsing is for Pokemon. Marie on the other hand showed no such concern, not when they were so close to uncovering the secrets of Eclipsing and maybe create devices that can Eclipse Pokemon and turn them back. This was too much for Jackson and he told her that he would leave Siara with Asher. He did just that while Marie went on to create that device. End of flashback and we arrive in Amor City.

We can't get back on the train :/ a Metro Pass is required. Valora is waiting for Asher below, she says Jackson is in the main lobby of the station. The vending machines that you see on the way down are ticket and voucher machines, Asher already has one. Descend the stairs and enter the Amor Battle Centre to join Valora and Jackson.

AMOR BATTLE CENTRE
------------------ 

Asher sees a lot of Trainers here, many of them look experienced. This should the tournament quite interesting. Afterwards he and Valora go to the front desk and register, they will be contacted by phone when it is time for them to compete in the first round. Jackson wishes them all the best and tells Asher that Prof. Ivo wants to meet him in Azluf Town. We'll need to travel back to Sovio and head east to Route 2 in order to reach Azluf, so Jackson gives Asher the Metro Pass and leaves to do some work. Valora asks if she can go with Asher to Azluf, he doesn't mind, and then the two of them are joined by someone else who's looking to enter the tournament - Frio! Looks like Asher may have himself a textbook obnoxious Rival now, because Frio can't believe that he's going to be in the tournament too. He isn't very nice to Valora either. Nothing we can do about that except leave Frio to get his registration done. The exit is south from the front desk, while the tournament match areas are found after going through the other exit which is below the stairs. We can't explore the rest of the city because some construction is going on so hop back on the train to Sovio. While on the train we'll find a few foreign passengers, including a Japanese woman who is either cosplaying as a Siara Grunt or is one of Siara's foreign recruits haha, I don't know. Find a seat and the game will show us a list of destinations, only Amor and Sovio are available for you to go to. Once you're back in Sovio, stock up if you need to then head east and south to the next route.

Yeah, maybe Valora should've waited for when she's a lot stronger before challenging. How will she do in Round 1? For now though she decides to go on ahead to Azluf and wait for Asher there. No problem. The Scientist standing outside the Day-Care gives out the "Egg Research" Quest:

She is looking for an Oval Stone, which is held by the Happiny on this route. In exchange for it she'll give you a Togepi Egg. Southeast from the Day-Care climb the first stairs, head south to pick up a Revive between two rocks and then climb the next stairs and continue south to Cameron.

Just after descending those stairs Asher is stopped by someone, a very familiar face who is also taking part in the tournament - Lucas! Asher saw him among the Trainers in Amor City. Lucas came here from Sinnoh to win and asks Asher for a friendly match. Asher thinks about this for a moment and figures it would be best to accept the challenge.

Prof. Ivo is already out here waiting for Asher, she takes him to a bench next to a lovely statue of the Sinnoh Lakes Guardians and the two of them have a chat about Jackson. During this we get to know more about Ivo: she has known Jackson for longer than Marie has. Ivo went to the same college as Jackson and they grew close. But their paths went in differen directions, Ivo became a scientist studying Pokemon while Jackson met Marie and they formed Siara. But Ivo and Jackson reunited and she helped them develop Eclipsing. Then came the time when Jackson told her to destroy all the research related to that project. We get a flashback to the day when Ivo received a phonecall from him after he left Siara. Interesting to note that Jackson left Siara with Asher when he was only 5. Ivo did destroy all the research but it turns out that Asher heard the myth about the Great Eclipse and Ivo gives the real story, though as a hypothesis: we learn that there was an asteroid around the same time as the Eclipse event 300 years ago. The asteroid didn't collide with the planet and Ivo believes it may have exploded in the atmosphere because all around Hupest there are rocks and craters. It is the meteorite fragments which contain a mineral which triggers Eclipsing. Although Ivo destroyed the research and Siara continued the project, Ivo went on to create a device which can instantly transform Pokemon into Eclipse Forms - an Eclipse Band. It draws out the power of fragments which Ivo calls Eclipse Shards. The transformation is permanent though. Ivo gives the Eclipse Band to Asher, she believes he might be able to figure out the secret to Eclipsing. But the Shards which are needed for it are hard to find and they are one-time use. No samples from Ivo unfortunately but she does finally give us a PokeDex. It has a function which shows Stats, Abilities and Habitats of captured Pokemon. Neat :) Asher thanks Ivo for this and after she leaves, Asher receives a text from the Amor Battle Centre - Round 1 is about to begin! He is told to return to Amor City to compete. Let's check out Azluf first before we head back to Amor. 

Behind the PokeCenter is a tuft of grass, check it for a hidden TnyMushroom. The stall next to the building is Claire's organic market: 

Moomoo Milk P500
EnergyPowder P500
Energy Root P800
Heal Powder P450
Revival Herb P2800
Berry Juice P100

Mental Herb P100
Leaf Stone P2100

The old woman roaming near the market mentions that Azelf appears here once a year, noted. The Move Deleter lives in the house north of the market. His housemate wants to trade her Excadrill for a Golem. Right next door to that house we'll find Professor Oak! Wow, Lucas and now Oak, the surprises just keep coming, eh? He checks out our PokeDex and asks us if we can help him with his research. Say Yes if you want to accept his Special Quest and the game explains what these are. They take longer to complete than regular Quests because they can involve multiple tasks which offer multiple rewards. Although they cannot be cancelled they do not affect normal Quests. This Quest involves having caught a number of Pokemon. 10 Pokemon gets you a Bulbasaur: 

BULBASAUR - The Seed Pokemon
Level: 5
Type: Grass/Poison
Ability: Overgrow
Moves: Tackle, Growl

No worries if your party is full, it will be sent to the PC. 25 Pokemon gets you a Charmander: 

CHARMANDER - The Lizard Pokemon
Level: 5
Type: Fire
Ability: Blaze
Moves: Scratch, Growl

And 45 Pokemon gets you Squirtle: 

SQUIRTLE - The Tiny Turtle Pokemon
Level: 5
Type: Water
Ability: Torrent
Moves: Tackle, Tail Whip

Those are the only tasks that Oak has for us for now. North of town is the entrance to Mt. Gerhana, we can't go in yet because some mine work is happening in there. Next to the entrance is a tuft of grass, you'll find a hidden Everstone there. Southeast from Oak's house is a Fisherman who gives us a Fishing Rod. Great to see that this game just has one, I was dreading the idea of collecting 3 Rods like usual. There's also a hidden Pearl on the left side cliff (or see screenshot). In the southeast section of town is the lighthouse, there's a Gentleman inside the house next to it who gives us the "Medic!" Quest: 

[q04] Medic!

His Spearow is sick, to cure it he needs a special flower which grows in a closed off spot on Route 2. We would have to travel through Mt. Gerhana to reach that spot. 

Where's Valora? Wasn't she supposed to be waiting for Asher here? Hmm, maybe she went off to Amor already. We're done exploring Azluf so when you are ready let's head back to Amor. The woman at the Battle Centre front desk will show us the entrance way to the fight rooms. Go through to the next area and enter the top left room to start the festivities!

And there you have it folks, congratulations on surviving the first Round of the Eclipse Tournament! Not bad at all :) so in place of Gyms we'll have this tournament instead, I really like that. A unique alternative. New items are now available at Marts: 

Great Ball
Super Potion
Awakening

After leaving the Round 1 room and heading back to the Battle Centre lobby, Asher is stopped by Valora. She has also advanced to the next round, and that means the rematch between Valora and Asher is that much closer. While they're chatting there's an announcement that the Trainers who have moved up to Round 2 will be notified when it is time for those matches. Then Frio shows up and sure enough he swept through Round 1, so he just has to brag xD. This guy. He suddenly receives a phonecall and afterwards he challenges Asher to a little contest: Frio is supposed to go to Mt. Gerhana to find a mineral known as the Eclipse Rock. If Asher can reach it before Frio does he can keep it and perhaps gain some answers about Eclipsing. But if Frio reaches it first, he takes the next step to find out about Eclipsing. Let the race begin. Valora doesn't want Asher to do this alone since he isn't as informed about Eclipsing as Frio, so he needs as much help as he can get. Asher is reluctant at first about Valora tagging along but she's got a point. Return to Azulf and prepare for our exploration of Mt. Gerhana.

- According to the Eclipsing Guide, Carbink is one of the Pokemon which might be holding a Clear Shard or a Eclite Piece. When combined together by an item called an Eclicizer (?) they form an Eclipse Shard.

Right after they arrive, Valora asks Asher if they'll know what the Eclipse Rock looks like. He thinks they will. Then the scene shifts to Frio somewhere, he believes he is close to finding the Eclipse Rock. He descends a ladder and we go back to Asher. Go up, we'll see Roark on the right. If you accepted the "Medic!" Quest don't speak to Roark yet, climb that ladder ahead and follow the next path all the way to the closed off Route 2 area. The item ball on the bottom right is the Cure Flower. Take it back to the Gentleman to complete the Quest, he'll reward you with the Exp. Share. Back to Roark, he likes to collect rare minerals and his Quest is about finding an Opal. 

[q05] Roark's Opal

He says Opals are easy to find, either on this level or the next one. Check the small pieces of rocks next to Roark for a hidden X Attack. Cross the bridge and just before descending the ladder, check the rock pieces in the upper right corner for a hidden Escape Rope.

Turn right from him and go on to pick up a Rare Opal. If you accepted Roark's Quest deliver that to him and he will reward you with quite the Fossil collection: 

Old Amber
Helix Fossil
Dome Fossil
Skull Fossil
Armor Fossil
Cover Fossil
Plume Fossil
Jaw Fossil
Sail Fossil
Root Fossil
Claw Fossil

Incredible :) now let's hope that the Fossil revival process in this game is instant and doesn't require us to come back after some time to pick up each revived Pokemon. Return to Frost and carry on to descend the ladder that Frio used earlier. 

It leads to an area where some mining work is going on. Until this is done we won't be accessing the lower level, so head for the northeast exit. Continue going northeast to another entrance, be aware that after the next scene you won't be able to exit until the event is done so make sure you are ready before going through that entrance. Asher suddenly stops and suggests to Valora that she stays outside because he has a bad feeling about this. Valora argues at first because she wants to help but she trusts that Asher will be careful and agrees to remain. 

Inside the new area (there are no Pokemon here) cross the bridge and we'll see Frio looking at a large purple crystal. Frio is amazed, he thought Asher wouldn't actually show up. But now that he's here, Frio decides to tell him about Eclipsing: the crystal is made out of Eclite. The Eclipse Shards are made of the same material too. This is what begins the Eclipsing process but the true power which is required for it to happen comes from the user. You have to be a very special individual to be able to channel that power. There's a sudden quake and an Aggron appears from nowhere! It touches the Eclite crystal and transforms into its Eclipsed Form, which Frio thinks is too powerful for him to deal with and so he suggests that they run. But the Eclipse Band starts resonating with the Eclite and that calms Aggron enough for the transformation to reverse. Aggron leaves and Frio doesn't understand how Asher was able to do that. Asher says he felt an inner power which made him want to stop Aggron, but he also doesn't know what this means. Frio though finds this to be very interesting and is certain that the two of them will meet again. After Frio leaves, examine the crystal. Asher notes how he resonated with it and wonders if perhaps he is worthy of that inner power and also why Frio knows so much about Eclipsing. Then Asher collapses from sudden exhaustion. 

When he wakes up Asher is in his own bed, Jackson and Valora are there too. Valora went into the cave after the quake and saw Asher was out cold, after that she called Jackson and they brought Asher home. Asher tells them what happened and says to Jackson that they need to see Prof. Ivo right away, he wants to gives her the information he got from Frio. Jackson realises now that Ivo told Asher about her past and suggests that Asher should rest up first then they'll visit Ivo. After Jackson goes downstairs, Asher thanks Valora and promises not to get himself into danger again. 

12 hours later...

Asher is back in Lancio Town, go to the Lab to see Ivo. She tells him that Jackson and Valora are in the basement and they head down there to join them. Asher shares the Eclipsing information with her and Ivo concludes that with this information they are closer now to finding out about Eclipsing. She believes that Siara's method of Eclipsing is artificial since it can happen without that inner power of a worthy person, so they have the advantage because Asher has shown that he is worthy enough to pull off real Eclipsing. Then Ivo shows them a machine that she made while researching Eclipsing - an Eclicizer. She explains that there are clear Eclite crystals in the world a.k.a Clear Shards and they can be restored with the Eclicizer. It can also combine small Eclite Pieces into a fully powered Eclite Shard. Ivo decides to perform an experiment: she sends out a Pidgey and gives Asher an Eclite Shard. She wants him to try Eclipsing Pidgey, Valora reminds Ivo about Asher passing out before, but Ivo thinks Asher won't need too much energy to Eclipse a small Pokemon like Pidgey unlike what happened with Aggron. Asher starts to resonate and focuses on the Pidgey...eventually he succeeds in Eclipsing it but feels tired afterwards. It isn't as bad as before though. Thanks to the experiment working out Ivo decides to give the Eclipsed Pidgey to Asher to keep and train with. 

PIDGEY - The Tiny Bird Pokemon
Level: 5
Type: Flying/Eclipsed
Ability: Eclite Force (Reduces damage at full HP)
Moves: Tackle, Lunar Eclipse

She wants him to grow stronger as a Trainer and to master Eclipsing. Asher points out that he will need Eclite Shards, so Ivo recommends that he try getting some from that big crystal. 

After leaving the lab Asher receives a message from Valora, it says that Jackson has left already and she has gone off to wait for Asher in Samurion City. We'll have to travel through Mt. Gerhana to get there. Fortunately the game will then teleport Asher back to Azluf after reading the message. 

When we return to the Eclite crystal area though, Asher sees some Grunts ahead and they've taken the Eclite :/ although they don't know why they need it. Asher gets to them and one of the Grunts recognises him from the Sovio Sewers, so they have to get rid of him. There are 4 Grunts, we'll be facing 2 of them in Single Battles then the last 2 in a Gen 2-style Double Battle.

Despite the shocking loss, the remaining Grunts take some comfort in the Eclite making its way to their HQ. After the Grunts leave, Asher notes the direction they went in - it leads to Samurion. Cross the bridge and check rock pieces on the other side for a hidden Hard Stone. At the top of the stairs turn left to find TM39 Rock Tomb and then exit.

The first left turn just under the cave entrance leads to what remains of the Samurion Wall, a guard is halfway along the wall and gives a brief history lesson about it. I like the look of the wall. Continue south from the entrance to descend some stairs, you'll then get to an intersection. The south way goes out to Route 3 but the path is currently being cleared so head north and let's see the town.

Asher finds Valora in the middle of town and updates her on what happened to him in Mt. Gerhana. She says she saw Frio, we'll then see the building that he went into - a dojo. Asher suggests that they go in after him, he still needs answers about Eclipsing. 

SAMURION DOJO
-------------

Inside the Dojo, Asher and Valora find Frio up front with the Dojo Master. Frio is suprised to see them here but he informs the Master that Asher is the Eclipser he was referring to. Another Eclipser actually (!) and just as Asher is trying to process this, Siara arrives and that is Frio's cue to leave because Siara is back in Mt. Gerhana for more Eclite. They are going to another area of the mountain which has been blocked off all along. Asher and Valora leave the Dojo so that Asher can contact Jackson about this. 

Once we're outside, the scene shifts to a Siara Grunt and a new female character standing outside a closed cave entrance just above the Pokemon Center. They clear away the rocks and the new character calls for more units. Back to Asher, he suggests that Valora remain in town and wait for Jackson and Ivo while he goes on to investigate. Valora agrees to stay. Now we can have a quick look around Samurion before moving forward.

Southwest from the Pokemon Center is a tuft of grass, check it for a hidden TinyMushroom (see screenshot). Another tuft of grass is southeast from the Dojo (see screenshot) there's a hidden Chesto Berry. We can't explore the north side of town yet because there's a Psyduck trio that's in the way so head for that newly opened up Mt. Gerhana entrance.

We see Frio, a Siara Grunt and the new character in another area. They are here to get the biggest Eclite. Frio wonders if Asher will make it to this place and find out about his and Frio's ancestors. Interesting. Back to Asher, go south to confront the first 2 Grunts here.

Go south, that yellow item which you'll see on the left is a Water Stone. Cross the bridge and find 2 more Grunts on opposite sides. They don't say anything when spoken to individually but when you try to walk past them, well...

They were just there to keep us from reaching a ladder ahead, which leads to this blockbuster scene: 

In the area below we see Mom Marie, Frio, the new character and a trio of Grunts. They have found that big boss Eclite crystal which they came here for. Marie can sense the energy that it contains, this energy even affects the new character and Frio can tell what's going on since he's an Eclipser as well. Asher interrupts the proceedings and greets Marie, which surprises Frio because he calls Marie mother too (!) explosive :) Asher sees Frio to be of similar age to him and guesses that he doesn't know about Marie's past, so he goes on to tell Frio about it. The next bombshell is for Frio, who finds out that he's adopted. Damn. Marie took him in after his parents, whom she knew, died. Even though Marie still calls him her son, it has all been one giant lie for Frio and now he wants nothing to do with Siara, so he leaves. Marie doesn't seem broken up about that and allows the other woman to step up and battle Asher. Her name is Flo, Marie's most trusted subordinate, but before she can do anything Jackson, Valora and Ivo show up. Marie sends the Grunts after them while Asher deals with Flo.

Flo is stunned by the loss, and even more so by Marie's call for them to retreat. She doesn't care about Frio or the Eclite, because she's got another plan which is about to start. After the Siara crew leaves, Valora asks what happened to Frio. Asher doesn't go into details but confirms that Frio won't be associating with Siara anymore. He also says to Ivo that he doesn't know what Marie's plan is. Jackson suggests that Asher and Valora should focus on the upcoming Round 2 of the tournament. Exit Mt. Gerhana. 

With the 3 Psyduck gone now, go to the north side of Samurion. When he gets there Asher bumps into Frio. Given what happened earlier things are a little awkward now. Asher apologies for what happened to Frio and asks him what's next. Frio says he is still going to be active in the tournament and also he aims to find out more about his parents and Eclipsers. Since Asher doesn't know a lot about Eclipsers, Frio helps with more information: when Eclipsed Pokemon appeared here in the past, 5 Trainers from Samurion stepped up to fight them. They became the first Eclipsers after discovering the Eclite and figuring out how to use the power naturally. But as time went on, their knowledge about this got lost and now only a handful of people are aware. Frio also adds that apparently he and Asher are descendants of those 5 Trainers. Let that settle for a bit, that is quite the plot twist xD. Then the Battle Center contacts Asher to let him know that Round 2 will begin in a few hours but currently the Metro Line isn't running because of some maintenance that's going on. Frio prepares to leave, he's off to Amor City and says that Asher can go back to Amor on foot by travelling through Route 4. Despite him and Asher having Siara as a common enemy now, Frio hasn't warmed up to him. Back to typical Rival mode, huh? :S 

The field of pink flowers that Frio came from has two entrances, go down to enter through the south way. At the end of that short path is a hidden Miracle Seed (see screenshot). The north way which Frio came from leads to TM19 Giga Drain below and a house on the upper left side. Inside it are people who are praying...except for the guy on the right side of the room, he can't handle the silence. Before he leaves he'll give us a Soothe Bell. On the north side of the fence is a tuft of grass, search it for a hidden Awakening (see screenshot). There's another tuft of grass on the right side of the house opposite the fence, check it for a hidden Stick (see screenshot). In the house is a Youngster, he's the person who wants to trade their Froakie for a Bibarel. Outside the house is a guy with a Squirtle, he gives us the "Squirtle Gang" Quest.

[q06] Squirtle Gang

He found Squirtle on Route 4, by a river in a closed off hidden area. We have to reunite it with its family. Until we can Surf, it would be best to ignore that Quest for now. Before we head north to Route 4, you can head south to check out the Pokemon on Route 3:

Nice :) Burn Heals and Super Repels are now available at Marts. Return to the Battle Center and watch as Asher receives a text message from Valora. She has also made it through Round 2 and is waiting for Asher on Route 6 where she's training. The Gate leading to Route 6 is in the northwest area from the Pokemon Center/Mart. You can also go further up to see a little bit of the Red District (not THAT kind of Red District xD imagine that in a Pokemon game...). There's another Gate here in the upper left side which would take us to Route 12 if it wasn't blocked at the moment. Amor City is massive but I like the idea of Amor opening up bit by bit as the game progresses.

Follow the road up to the wandering Bug Catcher who's looking for Combee, there's a tuft of grass in between the trees above him (Ultra Ball, see screenshot). A few steps ahead from the Bug Catcher is Valora. She's enjoying the tournament and Asher admits that he's having fun with it too, although he hasn't forgotten about Siara and wonders what they could be up to. Valora is concerned too but says for now they should relax and asks for battle. If you didn't see this coming, you haven't been paying attention haha. Here we go, Asher vs Valora II.

Maybe next time Valora. Just as she's trying to figure out how Asher is so strong, there's a policeman down the road who has stopped a Siara Grunt. The Grunt claims he fell behind the others of his gang but the cop isn't buying it and might have taken the Grunt in if he wasn't tricked xD the old fake donut trick, works every time. Go to the policeman and find out that there's a gang which is causing trouble in the area. Police reinforcements have been called in to find them, Asher and Valora offer to help too. 

Proceed north from the policeman to find the entrance to the mine, which has collapsed because of a quake. The Quest-giving Worker brought dynamite to clear away the rocks but he dropped it in a patch of sand and he doesn't have any Pokemon so he can't go to search for the dynamite. This is the "Kaboom" Quest.

As we cross the bridge we'll see one of the Grunts, maybe the same guy from earlier, down below. On the south side of the bridge, turn right and descend the hill to pick up the Dynamite. Right after picking it up, Asher is attacked by a wild Lv20 Gible! Catch it if you can. Return the Dynamite to the Coworker, he'll clear the entrance to the mine and reward us with a Rocky Helmet. Inside the mine is an old stone tower which looks to have been built many years ago. That's all. Make your way back to the hill south from Travis. Once there go west, north and east under the bridge. Before speaking to the Siara Grunt, check the tuft of grass near him for a hidden HP Up (see screenshot). Asher and Valora corner the Grunt, who recognises Asher because Marie warned the Grunts about him. He maintains that he was left behind by the other Grunts but offers extra information about the mines and a nearby city, Destino. Valora confirms this, Destino is a mining settlement and Asher wonders why the Grunts would be headed there. The Grunt here won't let them leave, he wants a fight.

Asher will see 4 Grunts just up ahead, he and Valora stop to watch the next scene: the Grunts are about to start their operation...but then they lock themselves out of the area where that is supposed to take place xD, these guys. World class professionals right there. Two Grunts leave to sort out that mess. Back to Asher, turn right and climb up the rocky platform.  You'll see a yellow TM ball behind one of the big rocks up top, that's TM37 Sandstorm. The 2 Grunts who have been left behind don't even notice us when you pass them, get to the blocked entrance and Asher wonders how he and Valora are supposed to go after the others now. Right on cue Frio shows up. He isn't surprised to see Asher here, and he is also aware of Siara planning something here in Destino. Asher points out the blocked entrance and Frio clears it up, leaving Asher and Valora to face the Grunts while he moves on ahead. Thanks buddy xD.

Past him is a ladder which takes us back to Room 2, this time we will be on the upper side. Head northeast for the next entrance. 

-Room 4-

There are wild Pokemon in this small area, as we go south there's a commotion and Asher notes that it's coming from the den ahead where Frio should be. In the den we find him and 4 Grunts that are checking out a machine which will help them to dig up fossils. Asher and Valora join Frio and we find out why Siara wants the fossils - they aim to eclipse the ancient Pokemon revived from them. Frio is ready to stop the Grunts here and he does it in quick fashion on his own in a battle that we don't even see. But the Grunts already got the fossils that they came for and make their exit after leaving behind an Eclipsed Tyranitar. Asher takes charge and uses his power to return Tyranitar back to normal. After Tyranitar leaves, a rock almost falls on Valora but Frio moves her out of the way just in time. A turning point for Frio, perhaps? We'll see :) Frio leaves and right before Asher exits too he finds a Clear Shard. Nice. 

When we make it back to town, Asher receives 2 messages: an announcement about Round 3 starting soon and a message from Valora, she's already in Amor taking part. We still can't explore the rest of Destino City (Asher insists on getting to Amor) so get on the Metro Line.

**NOTE: 
- Now that we got a Clear Shard I went back to Ivo's Lab to try out her Eclicizer machine. If you speak to Ivo she'll reward you based on the number of Pokemon you've caught: 

10 Pokemon - Full Restore
25 Pokemon - Max Revive
50 Pokemon - Destiny Knot
100 Pokemon - Destiny Knot
150 Pokemon - Ability Capsule
250 Pokemon - Oval Charm
405 Pokemon - Shiny Charm

As for the Eclicizer machine, it works but once you turn the Clear Shard into an Eclite it can't be turned back. End of Note.

Revives are now available at Marts. After leaving the battle room Asher gets a message from Prof. Ivo, she hopes he's doing well now that Round 3 is done. She wants him to meet her in Jarro Town, which can be reached from Route 12. There's something that she wants to show him. Remember where the Gate which leads to Route 12 is, it's in the upper northwest area of Amor City.

"Highest of Hupest"

**TMs Required: Rock Smash. 

Places of Interest
..................
Pokemon Center/Mart
Ancient Hupestian Ruins

Just as Asher is passing by the PokeCenter, someone walks out - Cynthia, the current Sinnoh Champion! Wow, still the Champ over there? And Asher's little thought is right, we've been hearing so much about Sinnoh xD perhaps it is located near Hupest. Cynthia is here to watch the tournament as an invited guest but she came specifically to Jarro for the Ancient Hupestian Ruins. Since she has been watching the tournament Cynthia shares some comments about the Trainers she has seen so far, Asher, Frio and Valora. She finds Asher to be one of the promising participants. Before Cynthia leaves she gives Asher an Odd Keystone. Very nice. 

There's a yearly festival going on here known as the Ecly Festival but seeing how this is such a small quiet town, there's not much activity in the streets. On the north side of town is a Worker who has the "Angry Cubone Kid" Quest. 

[q10] Angry Cubone Kid

He asks us to calm down the Cubone that he found on Route 12. Once you accept the Quest, Asher goes into the pen where Cubone is and battles it...but Cubone suddenly evolves right before, turning into a Lv30 Marowak! Catch or defeat it, that's up to you: 

MAROWAK - The Bone Keeper Pokemon
Type: Ground
Ability: Rock Head
Nature: Bashful
Moves: Focus Energy, Bonemerang, Rage, False Swipe

Afterwards the Worker thanks us with a Pickaxe, the cool alternative to Rock Smash for this game. Fantastic. We can try it out on the rock which is blocking the path to the northeast house, but the house is occupied by a Hiker who justs asks how we got there xD. We'll do a proper backtrack run later. Behind the Pokemon Center you'll find TM44 Rest on the left side. Go to the eastern side of town and let's speak to Prof. Ivo. She is standing by the entrance to the Ancient Hupestian Ruins and once she sees Asher they go inside. 

ANCIENT HUPESTIAN RUINS
-----------------------

They are Hupest's oldest monument, although nobody knows its true origin or why it was built. But Ivo has been studying the texts on the walls and found similarities between them and an old language called Eklissi, which belonged to an empire that ruled over this continent that Hupest is on. The Ruins are all that's left of that empire, there's a prophecy too from that time which serves to warn the next civilisations about something. The prophecy is in 3 parts: 

"A majestic light which once came to destroy us, will shine upon us in four millennias..."

The first part could be a clue to whatever destroyed the empire. Asher asks if that could be the meteorite from the Great Eclipse event. 

"It was an angel which made the darkness of the night bright like the cherishing Sun!"

Ivo thinks that the second part also seems to reference the meteorite, particularly when it exploded and caused a bright light. 

"The angel lashed her anger on us and we perished to oblivion...But the next time the people will be ready...Three glimpses of light...three of the youth will arise to protect from her judgement, her anger."

Ivo isn't sure about the third part but this place is what she wanted to show Asher and to get his thoughts on it. She leaves, going back to the lab. If you inspect the middle wall, Asher notes that there are small cracks in it. Hmm. Great Eclipses, strange new Pokemon forms and now we learn about an ancient civilisation. The plot thickens, eh? Exit the Ruins and on the way back to the middle of town we get the announcement about Round 4. But before we return to Amor to compete, let's cover that backtrack run now.

Ultra Balls and Hyper Potions are now available at Marts. Jackson sends Asher a message, saying he's waiting for him in front of the Battle Center. He has come to get Asher for an emergency meeting. They have to see Prof. Ivo immediately. Exit the Battle Center to see Jackson and we return to Ivo's Lab. 

Valora is there too and she made it through Round 4 as well. Ivo shows us 3 spots that she has marked on a map: 

> Location 1 - Solare Island (in the northwest side of the map)
> Location 2 - Dotted Hole (the tiny spot on the center right side of the map)
> Location 3 - Siara Cargo Ship (the tiny spot on the small islands, center left side of the map)

She points out Location 1 specifically, there are abnormal energy readings coming from there and they are similar to Eclipse Shard energy. To get there before Siara does, Ivo tasks Asher and Valora with getting to Galinor City and finding a ride for them to Solare Island. Jackson says that the Galinor Metro Station is closed due to some leaking so we have to travel to Destino then cross a bridge to reach Galinor. 

Once you're back in Destino head west, the first house after the PokeCenter is occupied by Prof. Elm, he gives a similar Special Quest to the one that Oak gives except this time you receive Johto Starter Eggs. The first Egg is given if you've caught 60 Pokemon, second Egg is for 80 Pokemon and third Egg is for 100 Pokemon. After that go all the way west and out of town.

Follow the road west until you see the impressive structure we will be crossing - Galtino Bridge. Turn north, go all the way up to find a tuft of grass in the left corner (hidden Chesto Berry). Come back down and go all the way south, you'll find a Carbos below the stairs. Then get onto the bridge and see a crowd of people looking ahead at a scene unfolding: a girl is confronting some Siara Grunts who won't anyone cross. But then one of the Grunts sees a cargo ship heading for Solare Island, a ship which they were supposed to be on. Another Grunt isn't worried, saying they'll get to the ship, and right now they have the girl to deal with. They send out an Eclipsed Pidgeot to attack the girl before leaving. Asher steps in to help and faces Pidgeot. It is at Lv34 and you can catch it if you want or just defeat it.

Continue across the bridge, on the other side turn north and go up to find a hidden X Defend in the tuft of grass.

Asher and Valora take a look around, this place is huge, and just as Asher wonders how they are supposed to meet the person they're here for, a message from Jackson arrives. He has told his friend Harry to wait for them at the Cargo Loading Bay. Let's look around first before heading north to the Bay. 

Just above us is a Sailor who gives us the "Push it" Quest: 

[q11] Push it

We have to find a Cargo Key that he lost on Route 11. It's in the grass on the southeast side of the route. The reward for this is the Push Knuckle, Strength's alternative. Northeast from the Sailor is a tuft of grass, check it for a hidden Luxury Ball (see screenshot). In the southeast section of town is a Burglar, he'll give us TM05 Shadow Claw. 
There's a Rich Boy by the pond in the middle of town, he can't take care of that Eevee next to him so make room in your party if you want Eevee. 

EEVEE - The Evolution Pokemon
Level: 5
Type: Normal
Ability: Run Away
Nature: Modest
Moves: Tackle, Tail Whip, Helping Hand, Sand Attack
Item Held: White Herb

In this game you use the Shiny Stone to evolve Eevee into Glaceon, the Leaf Stone to get Leafeon and the Moon Stone to get Sylveon. I'm not sure about Espeon and Umbreon. At the beach on the north side of town go east and check the lone rock over there for a hidden Shiny Stone, while we're on the subject of evolution xD. Cross the northeast bridge over to the Loading Bay area. Above from the bridge is a tuft of grass, check it for a hidden Tiny Mushroom. Carry on west, turn north by the Sailor standing near a cargo container to find a Dive Ball. On the far left platform, almost hidden in the bottom left corner is a Water Stone. If you're ready get on the platform next to that one and see Harry. Soon enough Jackson and Ivo arrive, they are ready to board the ship that Harry has prepared. Everyone gets on except Asher and Harry, Asher wants to know why Harry is wearing a Siara uniform. We learn that Harry has been working for Jackson since his time in Siara and now he acts as a double agent. He used to be an Admin like Flo, who turns out to be Marie's cousin/Asher's aunty (wow), but he stepped away from that position. Asher wasn't supposed to be told any of this but it's better to know than not to.

- Oranguru has Passimian's Battle Sprite, I wonder what happened there :S so don't rush to Run when you see Passimian. 

Harry suspects that Siara have moved into the forest ahead, he'll remain here to watch the boat if you need to return to the mainland. Above the stairs on the upper right from Harry is an Energy Root. Next to Ivo is a stone tablet with a bit of text on it:

"Thou... see this pla... when the ti... comes"

What could that mean? Climb the stairs up top, turn left and check the tuft of grass at the end for a hidden Revival Herb. Continue up into the forest. 

Another stone tablet is just up ahead with this: 

= "Whoeve... ste... shall beware. Th... gem ... the key..."

Stranger and stranger. Turn right and pick up a hidden Pearl from the tuft of grass. Then go west to find 2 Grunts who have split up from the others because of barriers that they can't get through (which were triggered by one of the Grunts touching a crystal that activated the defense system). Valora points out the stone tablet next to them for Asher to read: 

"Onl... the one... worthy... ca.. clear the pa... to... truth. Le...crystal be... guidance..."

Asher figures that maybe he could be "worthy" since this might have to do with Eclipsing. The crystal is just above them, go up and touch it to clear away the barrier. The Grunts recognise Asher and proceed to battle him and Valora. 

Siara Grunt
- Lv30 Carnivine [Grass]
- Lv30 Honchkrow [Dark/Flying]
- Lv30 Luxray [Electric]
Prize: P3120

The Grunts flee afterwards, not wanting Asher and Valora to find "it". Whatever that is could be the cause the odd energy signals here. Plus there may be more barriers ahead, so Valora suggests that they should find more crystals. Go straight left to find a Max Repel behind the wall, then carry on to the next Grunt. 

Siara Grunt
- Lv30 Granbull [Fairy]
- Lv30 Floatzel [Water]
- Lv31 Herdier [Normal]
Prize: P3224

This next Grunt is behind the wall above and there's a 3rd Grunt on the far left. 

Siara Grunt
- Lv30 Starmie [Water/Psychic]
- Lv31 Gardevoir [Psychic/Fairy]
- Lv31 Wobbuffet [Psychic]
Prize: P3224

Siara Grunt
- Lv33 Passimian [Fighting]
Prize: P3432

Check the tuft of grass behind the wall above him for a hidden Occa Berry (see screenshot). There's a crystal below from him that we can't reach yet because of a barrier, so just make a note of this location for now. On the right from the Grunt is an Ether almost hidden by a tree top. Go south through the exit, it leads to the southwest side of the island. Turn right to find an Ultra Ball and below the stairs is a Big Pearl. Back to the forest, head north then northwest to see a group of Grunts blocking an entrance of another area. We'll be back later for that for sure. Go behind the wall below them to pick up TM04 Calm Mind. Come back down and continue east to confront that circling Grunt. 

Siara Grunt
- Lv31 Sandslash [Ground] 
- Lv31 Golem [Rock/Ground]
- Lv30 Bronzong [Steel/Psychic] 
Prize: P3224

Go north from the Grunt, there's a hidden Heart Scale (see screenshot). Come back and go southeast from the Grunt into a short passage between walls, there's an Eclite Piece below that and on the upper right is a crystal and a hidden Stardust (see screenshot). Touch the crystal to get rid of the barrier that we saw in the southwest area earlier. Then go back there to touch that newly reachable crystal. Proceed east from the Grunt who was going in circles. 

Siara Grunt
- Lv31 Quagsire [Water/Ground]
- Lv32 Stunfisk [Ground/Electric]
Prize: P3328

Touch the crystal ahead and continue east. 

Siara Grunt
- Lv31 Swalot [Poison]
- Lv31 Weezing [Poison]
- Lv31 Toxicroak [Poison/Fighting]
Prize: P3224

We'll find an entrance and another stone tablet: 

"Ones... got this fa... may st... in..."

Go through to the next area. Jackson and Ivo join Asher and Valora here. No Siara in sight but Ivo can detect more energy readings from ahead. The group go up to find a strange gem, the source of the readings...but then the readings suddenly vanish. How odd, there's no time to examine it further because Marie and her Grunts show up. Thanks to Asher being an Eclipser, Siara was able to find this place and now they want that gem. It looks like it's going to be 3 vs 4 but someone else arrives to even the odds for Siara - Harry. He punches Jackson out of the way and asks for the gem. Asher can't believe this guy, they trusted him! With his Eclipser power flaring, Asher faces Harry.

Before Asher and company can do anything, the Grunts take the gem and Siara make their exit by a helicopter that shows up. Gone just like that :S Jackson wakes up, he's okay but just like Asher he can't believe Harry would do what he did. Ivo though thinks Harry had his reasons, she doesn't think he would betray a friend. Ivo tries to track the gem like how they were able to locate it by those energy readings but there's no signal, perhaps it is being blocked. There's nothing they can do for now except return to the lab, Ivo calls the authorities for transport since Harry's boat is gone now. When everyone is gone, a new character shows up and gets to the shrine where the gem was. They are on the phone with someone who wants to know what this character sees here. That other person also detected those energy readings before. There's nothing now so the new character is told to take pictures and return to wherever they came from. 

Back at Ivo's lab, Jackson is checking the map for clues about the gem but no luck so far. With the gem gone, the signal has grown weaker. On the bright side though, Round 5 is announced and there's an advert about Amor Mall being opened. While Asher and Valora focus on the tournament, Jackson and Ivo will continue their search. He tells Asher and Valora to come back to the lab after their matches. 

After the scene, we reappear in Amor City. The Amor Department Store is in the northeast section of town, let's have a look over there.

Ice Heals and Max Repels are now available at Marts. Out of all the Rivals that have appeared in the Pokemon games so far, I found Barry to be a bit annoying when I first played Gen 4 years ago. His Battle and Encounter themes weren't memorable too. But you know what, maybe I'll replay Gen 4 again someday and see if my views have changed over time. On the way back to the Battle Center Asher is stopped by Dawn. She hasn't forgotten about Galtino Bridge and now that both of them have advanced beyond Round 5 she is hoping they could go out to eat somewhere to celebrate, but Asher has more pressing matters to attend to so maybe next time. They exchange numbers though. Watching this scene from close by is Valora, with some hints of jealousy brewing below the surface. Hmm. After Dawn leaves Valora catches up to Asher and despite things being awkward between them now, they head back to the lab. Would any of you be surprised if at some point Valora runs away and Asher will have to save her...? 

Ivo has an update - a strong signal is coming from Location 2 (Dotted Hole) but there is a weak signal from Location 3 (Siara Cargo Ship) too so Ivo proposes that they split up into 2 teams. Ivo and Valora will go to Location 3 while Jackson and Asher will head off to Location 2, which Siara may be aware of. Asher notes that Valora has been acting strange since they came back from the Battle Center. If only you knew xD. Jackson says they can reach the destination from Route 16, whose Gate is on the eastern side of Amor.

The girl near the end of the road says there's a bridge ahead but it collapsed because of a big storm. The bridge leads to Aurin Town. Proceed to the start of the bridge and after Asher sees the remains of the bridge, Jackson arrives and tells him that they need to get to Aurin, though it isn't one of the friendliest places in the region. So how do we get there? Jackson shares an app with Asher called the FastSwift service, the alternative to Surf. Reach a body of water and Press A to use an inflatable boat to cross the water. Ahh technology :) Jackson notes that Asher and Valora have been odd since they came back from the Battle Center and after figuring out what the problem is he offers Asher some relationship advice. Ahh women, the great enigma xD, Asher takes the advice and plans to speak to Valora next time. Meanwhile, Valora and Ivo are on an island south of Galinor. This is as far as they can get to the signal, until Valora wonders if maybe whatever they are looking for is underwater instead. Ivo takes this into consideration and then the two of them talk about why Valora is helping and sure enough the conversation moves to the situation between Valora and Asher xD. Indeed, Valora is a little jealous of Dawn even though Asher politely turned her down. Then we find out that Ivo had feelings for Jackson...or better yet, might still have some. Well, well. Valora agrees to keep that little secret between them. 

Back to Asher and now that we can Surf, I think it would be good idea to get the next backtrack run out of the way now before we move forward. So get ready. 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
>THE GREAT BACKTRACK: SURF EDITION<
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

/LANCIO TOWN\
- Across the pond on the north side: Amulet Coin. Surf southwest from town to find a house on an island. Inside is Prof. Rowan, he'll give away the Sinnoh Starters if you have 250 or more Pokemon. 

/AZLUF TOWN\
- Surf round to the southwest cliffs to pick up TM40 Aerial Ace. Surfing east will lead you to a section of Route 3 where there's an island with a locked house. Asher wonders if a key could open the door. Noted. 

/MT. GERHANA (From Samurion)\
- In the middle of Room 1: TM06 Toxic. Head north for the entrance to the other area of Room 1 which has a pool of water, across it is TM12 Flash Cannon. Return to Samurion City and speak to the Joggler on the north side, we can accept his Quest now. 

[q06] Squirtle Gang (continued)

Go north onto Route 4, get to the river and surf northeast to find the closed off area and the other Squirtle. Stand on the north side of the gathering and Squirtle reunites with the squad. The Joggler shows up and rewards us with the Itemfinder. Surf to the western side of the river, there's TM31 Brick Break on the upper left bank. Then there's the couple of Swimmers that look to be blocking access to the remaining west side. Or are they just there...?

/ROUTE 11\
- Get in the water from the northeast side of the route, surf west a few paces to find a sandy patch of land with a tuft of grass on it (hidden Pearl). Continue west to another sandy patch (TM41 Scald). Go back east then surf west along the south side of the bridge until you see a big rock near the edge of the southern shore. Just southwest of that rock is a tuft of grass (hidden DeepSeaScale, see screenshot). Surf left from there to pick up Soft Sand from the patch of land. 

/SOLARE ISLAND\
- It is reached by surfing northwest from Galinor City. The Siara Grunts are long gone and that gives us access to the northwest area which they were guarding. It is a cliff that has a weird box which looks old. What could this be? Noted for now. That's it for the backtrack run, return to the collapsed bridge area on Route 16. 

Surf east until you reach an island with trees.

Welcome to Aurin folks, the slum of Hupest according to Jackson. He speaks to the Burglar ahead, hoping to find out if he has noticed anything weird going on around here. He points out an old factory to the north and says that the Pokemon in there have been acting strangely - they are more violent and have been attacking people. Jackson knows that place very well, it is what remains of Aur Factory. We'll head over there after checking out the town.

In the northeast house is a man looking for a Hippopotas, he'll trade his Mudkip for one. The Fossil Revival House is in the southeast area of town. Interact with the computer to revive all those fossils that we got from Roark, luckily for us the revival process is instant and the Pokemon get moved to Storage if you're packing a full party. Those fossils took up a lot of Item Storage space haha, damn them and good riddance...but we get some new Pokemon now, hoorah :) now you can prepare for the factory. On the far right side of the slope above the PokeCenter are BlackGlasses. Near the factory entrance, check the rock on the right for a hidden Ultra Ball.

Jackson remembers the factory from his childhood days, back then it was up and running. Items, devices, cars, etc they were manufactured here but other companies showed up in Hupest and the owners of the factory, Aur Inc., went bankrupt. People lost their jobs and this is why Aurin turned into what it is now. Even Asher's grandparents worked here. Jackson formed Siara with the aim to create jobs for people, but Marie had other ideas so... :/ there are criminals and other troublesome people here, Jackson warns Asher to be careful. Proceed up to find one of those criminals.

In this next area Jackson has been stopped by a unnamed Black Belt and his 2 sidekicks, it turns out that this is his territory and he won't let Jackson and Asher through....until he identifies Asher and changes his mind. The Black Belt will let them get on with their business if Jackson and Asher can find 3 Scrap Metals for him. Get to the top of 2 sets of stairs on the right, then cross over to the right side to pick up the 1st Scrap Metal. Go back and head to the left side, you'll see a grey beam on the south side, it leads to a Scrap Metal and then the final one is in the left side corner. Take them to the Black Belt and everything is cool with him now. Climb the stairs from where you found the 1st Scrap Metal, follow that path until you see an entrance above you and a south path. Go south to pick up a Luxury Ball then head for the entrance and sit back for the following scene from earlier:

We see Siara Admin (and Asher's aunt) Flo with some Grunts and that new character who appeared at Solare Island. The new character asks Flo what they are planning to do with the things they have gathered but Flo doesn't go into details. A helicopter arrives to pick up the Siara team now that their mission is complete (after collecting another gem!). The new character is too late...and since all this happened earlier, so are Asher and Jackson :S the new character speaks to that other person on the phone and they wonder what Siara wants with the gems. He asks if he should go after them but the caller tells the new character to return. Back to the present time, Asher and Jackson arrive in this room. They see the new character but he takes off, thinking that Asher and Jackson are more goons. Then Asher notices that the rock formation in front of them is the same as the shrine on Solare Island, he wonders if that new character guy took the gem. Jackson couldn't identify him because he was masked. The Battle Center sends the announcement about Round 6 and Asher has to leave. Jackson says he'll call Ivo to set up another meeting. 

We return to Amor and head for the Battle Center whenever you're ready.

And a few paces south from Rick is Valora, on her way to Maple Town. This is when Asher and Valora have their make up conversation and work things out. It's because this romance angle has been added to the story that I still think at some point Valora will get into trouble and needs to be saved by Asher. I would be surprised if it doesn't happen. After the scene, we can check out the house. It belongs to someone named E but is currently empty. Who is E? Return to the wheat field and follow the path west.

Asher and Valora arrive to find Jackson and Ivo going down memory lane. They were out here in the countryside many years ago. Moments later Ivo confirms that whatever she and Valora were looking for is underwater. It would take too much time to search around the sea floor so Jackson says they need some clues. Valora and Asher notice that they have a spectator nearby - Frio. He's heard the conversation and has an idea of the underwater location of what Ivo is looking for. He runs off while Valora and Asher agree to help in finding those clues, this will give them a chance to chase after Frio. Let's look around first. 

On the east side is the Maplet Market, this is where we find the Move Maniac and the Move Deleter. Bring her 2 TinyMushrooms or 1 Big Mushroom for her services. What I've noticed during my playthrough is that many of the Pokemon in the game have had their Abilities swapped around or changed and their regular Movesets have been changed too. Also moves like Thief, Covet, Knock Off, Skill Swap etc and Abilities like Trace and Frisk which I rely on for my walkthrough work are not in the game (you would have to steal a Trainer's Pokemon that knows Knock Off, funny enough). I don't understand why this was done. Next to the Move Maniac is the Move Deleter. Go south from the Market, surf down until Asher says he shouldn't be going that way then go west to a shore. Behind the fence there is TM20 X-Scissor. 

Go into the wheat field just west from the PokeCenter, we'll find Barry blending in with his surroundings xD. His Special Quest involves showing him a number of Pokemon that you've caught. If you've captured 275 Pokemon, he'll give you the Alola Starters. After you're done in Maple go west for Route 8, the Frio chase begins now.

Go to the south side of town. Valora wonders why Frio would come here after Asher says he saw him go in this direction. Speaking of Frio, he steps out of a house and isn't happy to see that Asher and Valora followed him. But he listens to them as they explain the situation. He admits that he doesn't know the exact underwater location but he still won't help them. Speaking of perfect timing, the announcement message for Round 7 appears and now Frio wants to play another game with Asher: if Asher makes it through Round 7 Frio will share the information that he needs. Great :| He suggests that Asher and Valora return to Galinor by Route 9. After he leaves we can enter the house that Frio walked out of, which is for sale though. Head upstairs to find an Eclite Shard. 

The woman outside the house knows Frio and she tells us that he and his family used to live in that house. His parents were attacked by "weird Pokemon", they chose to save Frio instead of themselves. Mystery solved about Frio's parents? :/ next door to the house is a Cooltrainer who wants to trade his Rhydon for a Lairon. That's all for Mulberry, go northwest for Route 9.

Full Restores are now available at Marts. Right after the match Asher meets Frio outside the battle area, he made it so let's hear that information: Frio says that the place Asher and company are looking for is likely to be an old Siara laboratory which is underwater near Maple. Asher asks Frio why he won't help them stop Siara, Frio doesn't want to be involved even though he really dislikes Siara now. Oh well, thanks for the info though. A message from Ivo arrives, saying that Asher and Valora should meet Ivo and Jackson on a small isle south from Maple. 

We'll pop up in Maple, prepare if you need to then surf south.

Go southeast from him to the north side of an island of trees, you'll find TM27 Return there. Come back and surf to the southwest side of the island. You'll see a tuft of grass between trees, check it for a hidden Net Ball. Then Asher and Valora find and speak to Ivo, telling her what they learned from Frio. Up ahead Jackson is inspecting an entrance which could lead to the abandoned lab, the entrance wasn't there before. Who could have reached the lab already? Go through the entrance, we'll appear in a cave next. Descend the stairs, Asher notices a miner machine below near another entrance. In the second area Ivo points out that the place has electricity running despite being 10 years old. There's a bust elevator panel but Ivo fixes it and the rest of the team rides the elevator into the lab. When we go in there are 5 floors given as options. 5F requires a Card Key so ignore it for now, same for 3F to 4F even though they don't need a Card Key.

**NOTES:
- An Eclipsed Pikachu [Electric/Eclipsed] is found here too, Lv40, holding Leftovers. Catch or defeat it.

Once Asher arrives here, Ivo contacts him and says that the elevator is working because of a backup generator. The main generator isn't active and so there are doors that can't be opened. He must find the generator room and turn on the power. Ivo warns him that there are Eclipsed Pokemon here too, no idea why, so he should be careful. The sign next to the closed area on the left says the doors are password protected, the password is on the computer in the southeast corner of this room but until we turn on the power the computer is useless. Next to it though is a Full Restore and below the computer is an old diary with an entry from 5 April 2011...written by Marie (!): 

"This is it! I have finally set up the entire Laboratory. Here I'll fully develop out Eclipsing, so that Jackson will believe that it's safe. Can you believe he left with our 5 year old son?! I can't mess this up. If I prove this is completely safe we can be a family again..."

Interesting. Does this make Marie a sympathetic character now? Go back up to the locked doors and go through the doorway below them. An Eclipsed Quagsire [Water/Eclipsed] will attack us here like that Eclipsed Pikachu in the previous room, catch or defeat it. Another computer and diary are here too: 

"4 December 2011. The test subjects are alive but can't sustain themselves for too long to stay alive...On another note, I might have found something interesting. On my trip to Samurion City today, I met a little boy who lived in the dojo with the master there. Apparently he was an orphan and the teachers told me his parents passed away 5 years ago. He was said to be a bit quirky, as he always kept a purple gem with himself..."

We know who that is :S descend the stairs.

The locked room on the left requires "Code Blue" from one of the computers. Go straight south to enter the Generator Room. An Eclipsed Solrock [Rock/Eclipsed] pops up here, catch or defeat it. There's an Ultra Ball in the bottom right corner. Interact with the computer to turn on the power. Ivo confirms that there's a signal coming from B5F, but an Ec Card Key is needed. Right after Asher says he'll search around for it, Ivo warns him about something coming his way!

GOLEM - The Megaton Pokemon
(Eclipsed Form)
Level: 40
Type: Ground/Eclipsed
Nature: Naughty
Ability: Eclite Force

Catch or defeat it. Go back to B2F, interact with the computer to learn Code Red, which unlocks the doors up top. You'll find an Eclite Shard there. Enter the room where we found the second diary entry, the computer here has the Code Blue. Back to B3F, unlock the doors and just before we reach the stairs an Eclipsed Yanmega appears. Catch or defeat it.

YANMEGA - The Ogre Darner Pokemon

Nature: Brave
Ability: Eclite Force
Moves: Uproar, Pursuit, Eclite Blade, Terra Storm

The stairs lead to a closed off section of B4F, we need Code Green to unlock the doors. Head back up and return to the elevator.

Just before reaching the table, we'll encounter an Eclipsed Gengar. 

GENGAR - The Shadow Pokemon
(Eclipsed Form)
Level: 40
Type: Ghost/Eclipsed
Nature: Lax
Ability: Eclite Force
Moves: Poison Gas, Will-O-Wisp, Eclipse Beam, Dream Eater
Item Held: Leftovers

That's a Revive on the far right of the table. The diary entry up top is from 1 September 2013: 

"I adopted the little boy from two years ago and named him Frio. I have also made a groundbreaking discovery because of him! The gem he always kept with himself seemed to calm Eclipsed Pokemon down...Normally they are really violent but the gem caused them to be controlable. The test subjects still can't be kept outside of tubes but we found the reason. The process is tied to a material called "Eclite". We tried using chemicals similar to the components of Eclite. However due to Eclite's unique origin, it's not possible with Earth elements...We need Eclite to continue on...A lot of it!"

And the bottom one is from 31 October 2014: 

"I found out more of the origin of Eclipsing...Apparently Frio is part of an Eclipser family...A bloodline of people having the ability to use Eclite as a way to channel their spirit and Eclipse Pokemon without technology. I must train him here now! I managed to make a test subject which doesn't require life sustaining equipment...I can start training Frio's Eclipser power to get the full potential out of this!"

The computer has Code Green and those doors on the left side need Code Yellow so go back to the previous B4F section. Unlock the doors and watch out for Eclipsed Excadrill!

EXCADRILL - The Subterrene Pokemon
(Eclipsed Form)
Level: 40
Type: Steel/Eclipsed
Nature: Hardy
Ability: Eclite Force
Moves: Hone Claws, Slash, Eclite Edge, Iron Head
Item Held: Leftovers

The notice on the left gives the numbers of failed experiments (405) and successful experiments (1). Very grim :| the Ec Card is on the table, Code Yellow is on the computer and the diary below has two entries, one from 6 June 2015 and one from 5 April 2016: 

"I managed to make a quick and cheap way of Eclipsing Pokemon! I also created a special band for Frio that he can use to Eclipse Pokemon, helping his training."

"This is bad! This is bad! Eclipse Pokemon have gone berserk all over the Laboratory! We can't control all of them...We need to leave immediately and seal this lab away! That way, the test subjects might slowly die off..."

Damn :S Head back to unlock the Code Yellow doors and enter the Ailing Room, we'll find TM10 Dark Pulse on the far right. Head for the elevator and choose 5F.

Go straight ahead and who do we find here - that new character guy, and he has found a gem! His superior on the phone tells him to secure the gem and leave before Siara takes it, but Asher confronts him (still thinking that he took the Aur Factory gem). Soon the others show up. The new guy says he can't let them have the gem, thinking that Asher and company are dangerous. Looks like Asher will have to fight this guy, but when he mentions Siara it's too late for Asher to stop.

After the battle, the misunderstandings get cleared up and we find out that this new guy is Micah, the current Champion of a region called Colen (!) Colen, eh? Interesting. Micah heard about Siara's activities and came to Hupest to investigate. He gives the gem to Ivo, figuring that the team here needs it more. Jackson thinks it's a good things for them to have someone like a Champion helping them, although Valora isn't too sure about him since he was an unknown factor until now. Exit the lab. 

Outside we see Micah talking to his superior over the phone, who isn't too thrilled about him handing the gem over. Micah assures her that Asher and company aren't the bad guys here. He thinks Siara is gone now so he's heading to Light Island which is in Colen. After the call he shares some thoughts about Asher, who was pretty strong and Micah figures that he must be an Eclipser. Something happened to Micah 3 years ago but we don't find out what that was. After he leaves, the scene shifts to outside the lab entrance and we see Frio. He knows that the gem was found and wonders if he'll find some answers in the lab. He has to shake off those nerves and eventually steps through. 

Back to Asher (who surprisingly doesn't bump into Frio on his way in), go back outside and receive the message about Round 8 starting. Asher wonders about Valora and Frio, will they make it too? And who else as well? This is it ladies and gentleman, the final round is upon us at last. Make your way back to the Battle Center.

Congratulations to you for getting through the 8 rounds of the Eclipse Tournament! Now it is time for the Finals. As the announcement is made about them, we see some of the other Trainers who will be competing in the Finals: Lucas, Dawn and Frio. The Finals are going to take place on Eclipse Square, which we will reach after travelling on Route 14. Barry is happy to see his two friends have qualified for the Finals, he was defeated by Asher before so he knows how strong he is. Lucas and Dawn are looking forward to facing Asher. No words from Frio. Nest Balls, Timer Balls and Max Revives are now available at Marts. The Gate leading to Route 14 is in the newly opened northeast section of Amor.

Valora and Asher stop to chat as soon as they arrive. Asher expresses his concerns about Siara disappearing just like they have. Yup, he too has a bad feeling about this and who could blame him? Valora tries to keep him focused on the tournament, they have to get to the summit of this mountain and win. That turns Asher around and the journey continues. Follow the path to the north side where we find the first powerful Trainer here.

He's an Eclipser so he HAS to breeze through. It's that simple, huh? We'll see :) proceed to the exit.

Here we are at long last, Eclipse Square. Go up to the castle entrance and watch as Asher and Valora are joined by Jackson and Ivo. They are proud of the young Trainers for making it here and despite Asher being concerned about Siara, Jackson assures him that they will be ready if Siara reappears. Inside the building Dawn meets Valora, the most anticipated encounter ever haha, and things are civil between them...until Dawn sees Asher and says she wanted to thank him. Valora jumps in between them, saying Asher needs to rest after the long trip that they've had. Dawn realises what's up now and proposes that whoever advances in the Finals between her and Valora gets to spend a day with Asher. Why am I getting high school romance anime scenario vibes from this, xD?? And of course there's nothing Asher can do about the girls and their game. Then an announcement is made about the Top 16 ceremony starting soon, so participants should enter the arena. Jackson and Ivo wish Asher good luck before going off to find their seats in the auditorium. Prepare yourselves if you need to and when you're all set head up the stairs. Micah shows up to speak to Asher and wish him good luck too, he didn't even know about the tournament but he saw Asher's name listed among the finalists so he came to watch. After the chat continue into the arena. 

		 X-x-[[ECLIPSE TOURNAMENT FINALS]]-x-X

The rules of the Finals are laid out for us now: first off, the Top 16 Trainers will compete in singles battles against a randomised opponent until the Top 8 remain. Asher's first fight is against Dawn! A day spent with Asher is on the line, she HAS to win.

You know, Asher should just spend the day with both girls haha, seems like it would be a win win for everybody to me. No surprise about the Finals opponent, here he comes. Asher remembers their first battle in the Sovio Sewers and wonders how much stronger Frio could be now. Frio is happy to see him here and admits that he may have underestimated Asher. They've both made it this far, time to find out who is the best between them. Good luck!

It is over, Asher has defeated Frio! Congratulations to you for becoming the Champion!! The announcer declares that the Eclipse Tournament has ended and we get a recap of previous Finals matches. Afterwards Valora, Jackson and Ivo come to the stage to congratulate Asher. Frio is still shocked by the loss, Asher speaks to him and thanks him for the battle. It took a while but finally, Frio warms up to Asher and for a brief moment they are friends xD typical Rival. Everyone is told to leave the arena and look forward to the result announcing ceremony which will happen 3 days from now. Time to go home and rest.

The next morning...

Asher wakes up in his room, once he's out of bed Jackson comes in. He says Micah couldn't stay and congratulate Asher because he had to leave for a mission. Jackson receives a phone call from Ivo and he says to Asher that they must leave for Lancio right away, Ivo wants to see them.

At the lab Ivo shows them a DVD which arrived in the mail this morning. It was addressed to Asher....

The video shows Marie in a room somewhere and she makes it clear that Asher and his team have what she wants. So she tells him to come to Divampa Cave on his own with the gem. In exchange for that he will have Valora back because, surprise surprise, Siara took Valora! If you saw this coming from miles away, congratulations you are psychic :) 

After the video Asher demands the gem from Ivo, but Jackson believes that this is a trap. Asher says he isn't planning on giving the gem to Siara, he just wants to rescue Valora. It may be a trap but Asher doesn't have a choice, Ivo gives him the Purple Gem. According to the Map, we reach Divampa Cave by surfing south along Route 4. 

We'll return to Samurion, head north to Route 4 and surf west. That pair of Swimmers is gone now. Once you can land on the south bank, do so and follow the path to the cave entrance. Here we go, Asher to the rescue!

Ivo calls Asher to warn him about the cave's volcanic activity and says he should get out if he starts to feel weird because of the temperature here. Head for the ladder below, it leads to a spot where you'll find a Rare Candy. Back to the entrance area and go for the east entrance. Asher sees Admin Flo here, but she's not looking to fight. She is there to escort him to the meeting location, a cave balcony facing the ocean. After Flo leaves, take a few steps to the right and see a crack in the floor next to the rock on the upper right. Check that crack for a hidden Hard Stone. From the stairs go southwest to find a Full Restore next to a lava pool. Then head north to find Chip and Elliot.

On the left side from her is an Ultra Ball. Go north to find a Revive and a hidden Fire Stone on the right side crack. South from Izzy is the next ladder but a crew of Workers is in the way, saying that the area below has been closed off because of the extreme temperatures. Return to Area 1 and fall through the hole next to Scientist Elliot. We'll land on the north side of Area 2, just in time to be spotted by Wade.

Ignore the ladder and continue south to jump off a ledge. Go left to find a Nugget and climb the ladder back to Area 1. Once there head up, smash the rock and get TM35 Flamethrower. Then jump off the ledge on the left and make your way back to the ladder next to Coworker Andrew. 

In the final area go and drop down the hole in the southeast corner. You'll land on a section surrounded by lava in Area 2. Climb the ladder back up and get TM50 Overheat. Then head for the exit on the north side. Go up to see Marie, she's standing in front of a cargo ship and although she's happy to see him Asher is not here to chat. He asks for Valora and Marie asks for the gem, before telling Asher that Valora is on the ship. Asher won't board it and before he can do anything else he is surrounded by 2 Grunts and Flo. Busted :|

Moments later Asher is in a locked room, tied up and without his stuff - including the gem. A Grunt enters and reveals himself to be Frio in disguise! Well, look who has finally decided to help in the fight against Siara :) took him long enough. He went to the Abandoned Lab and read all those diary entries, this is what made Frio change his mind. He tells Asher that Valora isn't here, she's being held at Siara HQ. Frio will help him get off the ship, there aren't too many Grunts here. He gives Asher his phone but says that his Pokemon and stuff are locked in the next room. A master key is needed. Darn. After Frio leaves, exit the room. In the corridor Asher hides before a Grunt steps out of the next room. He has the master key and heads for the cargo area. After the Grunt is gone, go into the far right room to pick up a Heart Scale and then into the east room. The Grunt is there but isn't watching the table, Asher picks up the C. Room Key from it. Exit the room and enter the Cargo Area through the southeast doorway. You'll find a Dive Ball on the upper right corner and a Water Stone below. Now we can go back to enter the locked room and collect our stuff. After doing that and stepping out into the corridor there's a major problem, a number of Grunts run out and Frio comes along too. He says the ship is sinking now because of a leak (?!) the good news is there is a switch in the cargo area for emergencies like this but it is on a high level which can't be reached unless someone can move on top of the crates to it. Asher remembers seeing a switch in the room where he got the key, go back there and press the switch (it's on the wall next to the doorway). Now the Cargo Area is flooded. Back to the corridor and go through the south doorway to the next corridor. Enter the first room to find a Full Restore. More Grunts rush for the exit as Asher and Frio continue east. Suddenly a Sceptile appears, Asher wonders if Micah is here and if he's the one who has caused the ship to sink. He passes on a message for Micah to Sceptile, saying he should stop whatever he's doing because they need a little bit of time. Sceptile leaves, not sure if it got the message or not xD. Enter the far right room to get an Ultra Ball then go through the southeast doorway to the Cargo Area. On the crates is TM42 Facade and ahead of that is the Emergency Switch, press it. 

Somewhere in the middle of the Hupest Sea...

The ship has hit dry land, head for the exit in the first corridor. Outside the ship we see Micah, he can't get a signal on his phone. Frio confronts him about the ship and before things get worse, Asher steps in between them to clear things up. Micah learns that Frio is also an Eclipser but judging by how things have started between them, they won't be pals any time soon. Asher reminds them that Siara still has Valora and now they got all 3 gems. It's time to find a way into the HQ. After the chat go west to find Micah and Frio searching around, Frio says there has to be an elevator which can take them underground.  Next to the top satellite is that elevator, interact with either of the switches on the side. 

[sihq] SIARA HQ
---------------

-Exit/Entrance Room-

Micah suggests that they split up - Asher will go off to find Valora while Micah searches for the gems with a little help from Frio. He tells Asher that Valora is likely to be in one of the prison cells here. Micah and Frio use the warp panel on the left, while we enter the room on the right and use the panel in there. It sends us to the room next door. Go through the doorway to find a Full Restore in the other room then go back to use the next warp panel.

-Prison Cells-

Asher hides outside of view of 2 Grunts who locked up Valora. They have her Pokemon and are considering selling them. They leave for the lounge to rest, Asher wants to find Valora's cell first. That cell is on the far left side of the room. He tries to open the doors but realises that he needs a key, which those Grunts probably have. The lounge is the room where we found the Full Restore and as soon as we enter, the Grunts spot Asher.

Rescue Valora and moments after the reunion, they are found by Flo. She puts out the word to other Grunts to check the building now that Asher is here, so his friends are present too. Until they are found, Flo decides to fight Asher here and now.

Despite being defeated, Harry remains cheerful because Siara still has a plan they must finish. He leaves Asher and company to worry about that Poke Ball and whatever is about to wake up. Frio figures out that they have to switch off the machine. Go up to interact with the machine and shut it down, afterwards Asher obtains the 3 Gems. Although their power has been drained Frio believes that they should be returned to where they were found, based on what we read in the Hupest Ruins. There's a sudden quake, everyone leaves the HQ. 

Outside, Micah points out that the quake originated from Northern Hupest, where the Ruins are. Micah proposes that they go there, Siara may be there too, but Frio reminds everyone about returning the gems. How do they return the gems, given that their original locations are far apart? Micah says one of them can do that and he gives Asher the Soul Dew (!) then shares with him what he has learned over the years about Legendary Pokemon. He did have one as a partner at some point but we don't find out what happened to it. Asher just has to hold onto the Soul Dew and he might be able to summon Latias. He focuses as best as he can and soon enough Latias appears. The only way for Asher to prove himself is by defeating Latias in battle, so approach it whenever you're ready.

LATIAS - The Eon Pokemon

Nature: Adamant

Asher succeeds in defeating Latias and it trusts him now. Micah says Asher should hop onto its back and there you have it, we can Fly now :) Asher gives two of the gems to Micah and Frio while he prepares to return to Solare Island with the 3rd gem. Everyone is to meet up in Jarro Town at the Ruins later. Valora is to call Jackson and Ivo as well. 

Then we are shown Asher and Latias flying above Hupest, not bad. The red, green and blue squares are settlements while the purple dots indicate special points of interest. There are Pokemon above the clouds too, they may ambush you. You can access your Bag and check the Map if you've forgotten where Solare is. Once you're back there, place the gem back at the shrine and Asher hears a voice that tells him that he must find the box, it will show him the path. Remember where the box is? On the cliff reached from the northwest entrance in this forest. Once Asher examines the box a beam of light shoots out from it and points to the peak of a mountain which is near the Ruins. Asher concludes that Siara may be aiming for that peak. Then the game informs us that Soaring has now been added to the HuPhone's menu. Let's return to Jarro now.

At the Ruins Asher finds Valora, Jackson and Ivo. The adults were worried about him but he's okay now, he won't get kidnapped by Siara again. An entrance has been made through the center wall. Valora tells Asher that several Siara Grunts appeared and marched through here. Micah and Frio have gone on ahead to meet up near the summit. Once everyone is ready to move, go through the entrance and through the following cave.

Marie has had enough of this, she orders Harry and Flo to work on the meteorite while she deals with Asher. He learns that he got those Eclipser genes from her side of the family and that Marie thought it would be best to teach a descendant about the powers. That didn't work out with Asher so Frio was the next best thing but that failed too. There's no way for Asher to stop this except by going through his mom. It's been a long time coming but at long last it is Asher vs Marie, look lively folks because she's got a full team of Eclipsed Pokemon!

The meteorite breaks open and out comes the Angel of Destruction Eclactus!! The source of the Eclissi Empire's ending. All this time those 3 gems kept Eclactus sealed and calm, and now that their energy was drained...well, here we are. Marie tries to catch Eclactus with that odd Poke Ball but a protective aura around Eclactus prevents the capture. Eclactus is upset and Marie orders her group to evacuate. Frio suggests to Asher that they get closer to Eclactus since it is made up of Eclipse Energy and they're Eclipsers. Micah's got terrible news though, there are reports of Pokemon randomly Eclipsing throughout the region! So he leaves to take care of that problem. Approach the Poke Ball and watch as Frio stops Asher and tries out his plan of calming Eclactus down and lowering the aura. It works but costs Frio a lot of his life energy :| there's no recovering from this for him unlike when Asher passed out at Mt. Gerhana. Asher and Valora don't understand why he did that, Frio believes in Asher so he created an opening for him to take on Eclactus. He gives his final words, thanking Asher for being a friend and everything...and then he's gone. It's up to Asher now, he picks up the odd Poke Ball a.k.a the Ecla Ball and this is your chance to heal up before taking on Eclactus. The real final boss is here, good luck.

ECLACTUS the Deity
Level: 65
Type: Eclipsed/Steel
Ability: Eclite Force
Moves: Orbit Crash, Total Eclipse, Eclipse Beam, Flash Cannon
Item Held: King's Rock

After the battle, Eclactus disappears and all the Eclipse Energy readings are gone too. Micah returns, saying that all the Eclipsed Pokemon are normal again...but he surveys the scene and realises what has happened. Asher confronts Marie, making her see the error of her ways. She calls Flo and Harry to gather the other Executives for a meeting and leaves the Ruins. Later on Siara disbands and Marie hands herself to the police. 3 days pass and the Tournament ceremony goes on, with Asher announced for 1st place, Valora 2nd place and Lucas in 3rd. Hupest has been saved and your game file gets saved too :) 

Just before the credits roll we get a scene of Frio's spirit at the Ruins. His role as an Eclipser is done now and perhaps he can be reunited with his parents again. 

			//POST-GAME ARC\\

We join Asher outside his home on Inizio Isle. Micah appears, he congratulates Asher for winning the Tournament and then reveals that there are some thugs causing trouble in his region. Authorities believe that they could be the remaining members of Team Void, the main villains from Pokemon Saiph. Micah is hoping Asher can help him investigate. Jackson steps out of the house and after hearing Micah's idea, he has no problem with Asher helping. He gives Asher a letter that came for him - it is an official invitation to a place called Cord Island, a spot for the best of the best Trainers in the world. Together with the letter is a Cord Ticket, which will grant him passage by ferry from Dis Bay to Cord Island. Micah has heard a bit about the place, it is owned by a rich family and it is possible that they've organised something special purely for their own entertainment. Could be a scam too, according to Jackson xD who knows. Micah leaves and Jackson goes back into the house to work. The game informs us that the Ancient Hupestian Ruins have now been added to available locations. The Hupest Wilds are new availble area too. We can also hop on the Metro and reach Chargy City in the Colen region as well. Phew, so much to do and that isn't a bad problem to have :) figuring out what to do first is the real problem haha. Okay, let's check out the Hupest Wilds first, then Cord Island and after that we'll get on the Metro to Chargy City. 

**NOTE: 
- That exit in Area 2 of the Hupestian Ruins (which was blocked by a Grunt) leads to a lovely spot where Frio's grave is. Asher says a few words, letting Frio know about the mission to Colen and going to Cord Island. 

Fly to Aurin Town and go east. As soon as Asher steps into the Hupest Wilds he is met by Latias. It wants to join his party. No problem if you have a full party, Latias will be sent to Storage. It is at Lv45 now and knows Helping Hand, Recover, Magic Coat and Zen Headbutt. Our very first official Legendary Pokemon :) great.

We're finally here, not much to do so let's sweep through. Behind the Metro Station entrance is TM16 Light Screen. Check the tuft of Grass on the left side from there for a hidden Leppa Berry. Another tuft of grass is on the east side of the bay, you'll find a hidden Chilan Berry there. 3 docks are here: the east dock has a Sailor who hopes to sail to locations that have weird anomalies, the west dock has a Sailor who enjoys sailing to a mysterious island and the south dock is the one we're going for. I wonder when we'll set sail from those other 2 docks.

Above the stairs to the north are a Nest Ball, a tuft of grass where you'll find a hidden Yache Berry and another tuft of grass on the southeast cliff that has a hidden Tanga Berry. Return to the beach and surf east, you'll find a trio of Swimmers on the upper side who are blocking off an area for now. Next to them though is Battle Marine. 

[batm] BATTLE MARINE
--------------------

Interesting, Hupest's Battle Frontier. Rather than BP there are Marine Points/MP here instead. The Black Belt on the left side is the Marine Move Maniac, he'll teach a move in exchange for 10 MP (actually, he charges when you agree to the service and not after the Move has been taught...you've been warned) The Mart employee next to him sells current Mart items:

On the right side is a Scientist who offers the Egg Lottery service, give her 10 MP and receive a random Egg from 3 categories, each category results with hatching different species. Next to her is the Marine Archeologist, he'll trade you MP for valuable items that you might have: Nugget (5 MP), Star Piece (3 MP), Stardust (1 MP). 

Inside the building Asher is officially welcomed to the Battle Marine facility and given the Marine Case, allowing him to collect MP. Then he sees Valora ahead, being addressed by the man who sent Asher the invitation - Hav Cale. He offers to give Valora a tour of the island but Asher is right there to make his presence known :) Valora is happy to see him and explains that as the second place winner of the tournament she got an invite too. Hav tells them that the facility belongs to his super rich family and he's in charge. Although Asher is the Tournament Champion, Hav believes that over here he isn't a big deal. So he sets a little rule for the facility: if Asher loses he has to pay a small fine. What, is he serious? Hav says that he competes in the Battle Marine sometimes so if Asher wants to try his luck, Hav will be waiting. Valora isn't planning on trying out the facility, she wants to travel around the region and see places. Asher says he'll have a look around the island first before giving the facility a shot. Afterwards we are informed that other areas of the island are now available. The Scientist in front explains the rules of the facility: we will be facing random opponents and can only leave after defeating the current one or if we lose. Use of items and swapping out Pokemon is not allowed, however we can bring in a party of any size with any Pokemon with any Hold Items...and so can the opponents. Winning a battle earns us 1 MP. Hmm, no multiplier function? The Cooltrainer next to her gives out the "Marine Point Hunter" Quest.

After that you'll get opponents with Lv50 Pokemon in parties that vary in size. Healing is done after each match and then you are asked if you wish to continue or not. It is a little odd that some of the opponents have Pokemon which aren't even obtainable in the game, especially in the Legendary and Mythical Pokemon department xD. The absence of the point multiplier means you can just fight until you have enough MP and quit without worrying about building a streak from scratch. 

Once you're done with Battle Marine exit the facility and return to that path which was blocked by the 2 Workers. They're gone now and this is where our hike up the volcano known as Mt. Nit begins. Strap in.

From the entrance go north to the small exit which you'll see on the left side of the stairs. It leads to a small section outside where you'll find a Fire Stone. After that come back inside and go through the eastern entrance. 

-Room 1-

We'll appear in a room with 3 other entrances: north, east and west. Looks like a room from Lost Cave in the Sevii Islands. The east entrance takes us to a small area that contains a Sun Stone, the north entrance leads to a deadend so go west. 

-Room 2-

Go south, because the other two entrances lead to deadends. 

-Room 3-

Make a note of the south entrance, it leads to a room which looks like it might be occupied by a Mythical or Legendary Pokemon later. Go east. 

-Room 4-

Oh, someone's in here? A Black Belt who is facing the wall like he's up to something xD, he turns to be Bogdan one of the Cord moderators. Ahh, it all makes sense now...I was a little lost. DIS Bay and CORD Island. Clever haha, I will allow it. Looks like we found his secret hiding/training spot, Bogdan doesn't talk much but he's ready for a match.

After a short pause he tells us that he will go back wherever he came from and just like that he's gone. Random. Ignore the east entrance, go south back to the main area. We'll be on the western side. Continue going south until you head up some stairs, then turn left to find a Max Revive and go right to the exit. Once outside go left to pick up a Nugget hidden behind the rock. Return inside and return to Room 4 then go north. 

We have reached the top of the volcano and someone else is here - Marie. Wow, she's out of police custody already? That was fast :S she's out here getting rid of Siara and Eclipsing related material. One thing she hasn't thrown away and gives to Asher is the Ecla Armor. It's a prototype which resembles Eclactus's armor, Marie reveals that they gave Eclactus armor but it shattered. She doubts the lava here could destroy the prototype so she thinks it is best for Asher to keep it. Perhaps he can control Eclactus when he's got the armor plus his Eclipser power. Asher wonders if he can take the armor with him back to the Ruins, because maybe Eclactus is hiding inside the meteorite now that it has been weakened. Marie tells Asher that she won't be going back to Jackson after everything that she has done, she doesn't think Ivo would want her around too, so for now this is goodbye from Marie. 

Fly back to the Ruins, inspect the meteorite and take out the Ecla Armor. Eclactus emerges and sure enough, it is weak now. Asher uses the Ecla Ball and a new Pokemon is added to the collection: 

ECLACTY
Level: 5
Type: Eclipsed
Nature: Bashful
Ability: Tough Claws
Moves: Scratch, Total Eclipse, Hone Claws, XXX

Hmm, does it evolve into Eclactus later? That's our second major Pokemon after Latias, nice. 

Go back to Battle Marine and surf north from the spot which was blocked by the 3 Swimmers earlier. Eventually you'll reach a small isle occupied by a number of people, all of them except the Quest giver say the same thing about Asher looking like a strong Trainer. These people are the Cord Island Moderators and the Quest giver issues "The Mods of Cord" task. 

[q13] The Mods of Cord

The 5 Moderators are the royal guards of the Cale Family, the Quest involves finding them in different places of the island and defeating them. Bogdan will have to be found and battled again in the same spot we saw him. The nearest Mod from Bogdan is Meomite, he's on the cliff where we found the Nugget before meeting Marie.

Return to the isle where we received the Mod Quest and get a second Master Ball as a reward. But wait, there's more...the Mods have also returned to this isle, speak to them for extra rewards: 

* CG gives us the Gracidea and throws in a hint for how to use it: 

"Take it somewhere dark and creepy, take it to an abandoned place..."

Right...erm, any ideas about that one?

* Bogdan gives us the Lunar Wing plus this hint: 

"Take it somewhere ancient, but also remote, a distant place, with barriers protected...Find the shrine where bad things happened..."

Okay this one is much easier :)

* Lokei gives us the Magma Stone plus this hint: 

"Take it somewhere blazing hot, a place which can explode any given moment...Find the room where you had no business before and enter now..."

Pretty obvious. 

* Thale gives us the Adamant Orb plus this hint: 

"Take it somewhere ancient, on top of a big mountain...Take a left turn and step on what seems standing out..."

Hmm, not so obvious. 

* Meomite gives us the Lustrous Orb and this: 

"Take it somewhere ancient, on top of a big mountain...Take a right turn and step on what seems standing out..."

Also not so obvious. But no worries, we'll figure it all out when the time comes for us to chase after Mythical and Legendary Pokemon. For now though we're done with Cord Island. I thought there would be a major storyline involving the Cale Family but it turns out that the invitation was just for Asher to come and check out this game's version of the Battle Frontier. No meeting with the rest of the family or anything else except the Moderators, unless the other family members appear in the later stages of the Battle Marine challenge maybe? :/ oh well. Leave Cord Island and prepare yourselves, we're going to the nearest Metro Station and boarding a train to Chargy City in the Colen region. The adventure continues!

In the Metron Station we'll find a guard blocking a doorway on the south side, it leads to the Power Plant and unfortunately no visitors are allowed there now. Did something happen to the Power Plant in Pokemon Saiph? Exit the Station and outside we see Micah talking with the Pokemon world's most famous investigator Looker! You know things have gotten serious when Interpol is on the scene. He and Micah see Asher and introductions are made. We learn that Colen has been under Interpol's list of protected regions after events from 3 years ago. Looker is aware of what went down in Hupest and notes that maybe the region might need some Interpol eyes on it too. The other regions that he mentions Fiore and Almia, does anyone know which games those are from? Or are they just fictional?? Asher asks Micah if he lives here, Micah does not. He lives in a nearby town called Bydan Town and was about to return there to see his mother and someone named Wattles. Asher can get there by crossing Route 1. Chargy City is now available among locations we can Soar to, the Colen region is north of Hupest. Looker thanks Micah for working with Interpol and leaves to carry on his work then Micah leaves too. 

With this massive investigation going on, the western exit and eastern exit to Route 2 are blocked. There used to be a Gym here but the Pokemon League is undergoing some renovations and apparently the Gym system is getting a change too. Something to look forward to in the Pokemon Saiph sequel, eh? Nothing else we can do here so head south.

It's a simple route headed south so just follow it down then east into town. Before arriving in Bydan we'll find a signboard which says "Patter Forest" but that has been crossed out. I wish I had played Pokemon Saiph first because it would've been nice to recognise all these places and know what happened in this region before. The way things are going I am considering playing the current version of Saiph some time after I'm done with Sors. Without any documentation available for Saiph though, it will be a casual playthrough just to see how that game is.

Micah comes out to greet Asher and goes on to tell him a bit about how he and his family arrived here from Hoenn. Most of Colen's inhabitants are from West Hoenn. Micah spoke with Wattles about the investigation but he doesn't know anything. Micah isn't sure if Team Void is really what they are dealing with here but he hopes not. Suddenly he gets an alert and says he and Asher must return to Chargy City immediately. Something is going on at the Power Plant according to Looker. After Micah leaves, we get the update about Bydan being a location we can Soar to. Micah's house is the first one seen when arriving here, we can have a chat with his mom there. The eastern side of town has the exit leading to Route 10 but a group of male and female Nidoran are blocking that road. Perhaps it's mating season. The Lab is open, sadly Prof. Wattles is too busy to see any visitors so we can only speak to his lab aides. Afterwards head for the Power Plant. 

COLEN POWER PLANT
-----------------

Micah and Looker are here when Asher arrives, they show him what's going on: some Team Void Grunts have taken the plant employees hostage and are planning to sell off the power generated here! To make things worse the Executive in charge of this operation is with the employees in a small area closed off by an electric gate. Micah suggests that he, Looker and Asher split up to find the Master Card Key. Looker called HQ for reinforcements but who knows when they'll show up, so he agrees to act now with Micah and Asher. Once we can move go east and take on the first of these Team Void goons. 

Team Void Grunt

- Lv52 Druddigon [Dragon]

On the left side past him is a grey doorway to a small room occupied by a Grunt and Card Key B. 

Team Void Grunt

Exit and carry on to the southwest side of the main room. 

Team Void Grunt

- Lv51 Scrafty [Dark/Fighting]
- Lv51 Machamp [Fighting]
Prize: P3060

We'll find Card Key A here. Return up top and disable the electric gate. Asher, Micah and Looker confront the Executive. Although the operation has failed and the employees are saved, the Executive won't go into Interpol custody without a fight.

Right after the battle, Micah gets in the Exec's face and demands to know where "he" is. The Exec doesn't understand at first then Micah clarifies and mentions a name - Shenow, the boss of Team Void. The Exec explains that they are just a gang who copied Team Void's ways and name too. Major false alarm :S the Interpol officers arrive and Looker arrests the fake Grunts. After they leave, Micah apologises to Asher for getting upset and tells him that things are personal between him and Team Void, because Shenow almost killed him in the past. But he hasn't appeared since, which is why Micah thought that Team Void had returned. So it looks like the investigation is done now and Micah recommends that Asher explore Colen. Well that was quick haha, I thought we would be here to weed out remnants of Team Void across Colen. Darn, one more reason to play Pokemon Saiph. Exit the Power Plant and whenever you're ready go west to Route 12.

Leave it to the government to have a big old house like this in the middle of nowhere xD. Inside we will find 4 doorways: southwest, southeast, northwest and northeast....and also a little girl in the main room. Do not talk to her just yet. Enter the southwest room to pick up a Big Nugget. There's a Reaper Cloth on the big table in the northeast room. The northwest room has a Poke Ball with a letter attached to it: 

"If you find this Poke Ball...Do not open it! What lays inside shall remain sealed...Unless you are able to keep it under full control..."

Then we are asked if we want to open the Poke Ball. Whatever is inside can't be that bad, right? Yup, nothing to worry about. Say Yes!

...and reappears just outside a new place. What the..? Asher looks around then checks the Map. Shoray is in South Colen. Damn :S whatever that girl did is as good as Goku's Instant Transmission technique. The Hikers on the right are blocking the path to Route 8, they say it is undergoing some construction. Go into the city and head northeast from the PokeCenter, you'll find Nevermeltice there. Then go through the cave entrance on the northwest side.

Follow the path all the way east then southeast to a set of stairs with an item below them, that's a Shiny Stone. Go back to the stairs leading to the next cliff level, head east from there to a Strength puzzle. Push the bottom right boulder up, the bottom left boulder once to the left, the middle boulder once to the left then the top boulder up and to the right and carry on. The path eventually leads us to a cave opening in the northeast. After getting through the cave and coming back outside, head west to another Strength puzzle, this one has some breakable rocks added in to shake things up a bit. Push the first boulder down twice, smash the top rock, push the bottom boulder out of the way so you can get to that TM12 Flash Cannon below. Then go back up, push the next boulder up, smash the left rock and continue west all the way to the next cave entrance. Inside this section you'll see a Full Restore on the left side as soon as you arrive. Get to the northwest side to pick up an Ultra Ball before exiting. 

Outside, go all the way to the southeast edge for another Full Restore and then head up to the next entrance. We've reached the top of the mountain and we are not alone up here - Micah is here too. He's as surprised to see Asher as he is to see him. Micah says he comes here sometimes, although this is where he almost died. Even the woman who calls him on the phone doesn't understand why Micah keeps returning here. Something just keeps bringing him back. He also doesn't know why Shenow couldn't make this world better when he wanted one. Asher doesn't know either but he has had his fair share of crazy individuals. Moving on is all that people can do. Micah remembers what he said to Asher at the Abandonded Lab, about them facing off in a proper battle one day. Today is that day :) it will be Hupest Champion Asher vs Colen Champion Micah! A Pay-per-view level main event right there because it is the final major battle of the game (as if meeting the region's Champion at the top of a mountain wasn't enough of a hint haha). If you're not ready for it come back later. But if you are, here we go.

Asher has proven himself to Micah and it's official, he is the top Champ now. Micah receives a phone call from that boss of his, we finally get her name: Lori. She has been trying to reach him all this time, because a letter titled "invitation" arrived for him. Lori tells Micah to return to Light Island right away. Micah makes his exit and so does Asher, then the game is saved again. 

Just before the credits roll one more time we get a little preview for the next game Pokemon Saiph 2: Micah receives a letter from the president of a distant region. An invitation to a freedom celebration party. But Lori warns him that the region has a suspicious policy on foreign Pokemon. Micah isn't worried, he still has own strength to rely on. How will things go for Micah? What distant region is he headed for?? And when will this Pokemon Saiph sequel come out??? Find out next time on Dragon B... I mean whenever Pokemon Saiph 2 comes out :D 

(Official) End of Pokemon Sors.

But we're not done yet. There are some Quests remaining that we could try to complete. What sucks about the Quest system for this game is that unlike the Pokemon Unbound Missions system we don't get a description and location for the Quests. We may have to backtrack across the region to find the more obscure Quests. Not good :| but on the bright side there are other Legendary and Mythical Pokemon to be captured. And if you're looking for extra action in battle, you can go back to Eclipse Square. The Eclipse Arena is open now, it's another facility. Any Pokemon is allowed, any Hold Item, but only a party of 3 Pokemon can be entered. EXP is given out, items can be used in battle,  Prize money is issued if you win and taken away if you lose. You can leave after each fight whether you won or lost. The opponents are the character Trainers from the Eclipse Tournament, each uses 3 Pokemon too that are Lv55.

Return to Azluf Town and speak to Prof. Oak. He wants us to investigate Mt. Gerhana for a Pokemon that several Hikers and Coworkers have seen there - Mewtwo! It is located in the room where we saw the first big Eclite crystal. Use the Azluf entrance to Mt. Gerhana and navigate your way back to that room. You'll see Mewtwo where the crystal was, talk to it to initiate battle.

[null] TYPE: NULL - The Synthetic Pokemon

Guess where the pre-evolved form of Gladion's Legendary partner is. That's right - down in the Sovio Sewers :) in the room where Asher met Frio. Actually we don't find Type: Null there right away, we find Gladion first. Of all the places for him to be hanging out, xD. After the tournament he returned to Alola and talked to some Aether Foundation scientists, they informed him that his Type: Null isn't the only one. He has that second one and asks us to take care of it. After we accept, Gladion then challenges us to a battle to prove if we are worthy of Type: Null. Being Hupest Champ isn't proof enough...?

For any of you fans of Ultra Beasts, here is your paradise :) enjoy yourselves. While you do that, follow the path to the northwest corner of the island for the real prize - a Cosmog Egg. To this day the Ultra Beasts remain a mystery to me. I've only really encountered them in the ROMhack universe of Pokemon games (Pokemon Adventure Red Chapter, Pokemon Unbound and now here). They certainly look more Monster than Pocket Monster, I'll give them that much haha and some of them make me think of Fakemon. Is that weird? After you're done return Samurion City.

Fly down to Jarro Town and enter the Ruins. We'll find Riley here checking the place out and sensing a special aura. Agree to help him and he tells us about rumours of Celebi appearing on an island with a lush forest. He wants us to find it and gather data on it. We get the GS Ball from him too. Ahh yes, the GS Ball...that wonderful plot device from the anime xD, what a let down. Fly over to Solare Island and go to the area that has the weird box. Take out the GS Ball and just after Asher puts it on the ground, Celebi appears. Asher collects its data and prepares to return to Riley....but is suddenly sent back in time (insert time travelling theme song here) to Sovio a few hours before Valora was taken. Just as he is trying to understand how he has ended up in Sovio, Asher hears a familiar voice nearby - Frio. Asher realises now that he is in the past. 2 Siara Grunts show up, they are searching for Valora's house, one of them is called over into an alley where Frio is hiding and he steals that Grunt's uniform after putting him out. It makes sense now for Asher, how Frio ended up in the cargo ship to help him and everything. He asks Celebi to return him to the present. Celebi does so after joining his party. 

CELEBI - The Time Travel Pokemon

Go back to Riley to show him the data and complete the Quest. He'll reward us with a Riolu Egg. Exit the Ruins and go to the northeast part of town. Standing outside the cabin there is Silver, who claims that he isn't planning on stealing anything xD old habits. He found 3 Pokemon but believes that they are weak so he'll give them to us of we've caught at least 125 Pokemon. Those 3 Pokemon are the Hoenn Starters. 

On 2F of the Amor Dept. Store is Hugh, if you've caught at least 150 Pokemon he'll give away the Unova Starters.

Return to Galinor and if you're prepared for battle, enter the western building. Cynthia is here and she hasn't forgotten Asher from the first time they met in Jarro Town. She is still in Hupest because of the appearances of Legendary Pokemon and perhaps Asher can help her with that...but first, Cynthia insists on the two of them having a match.

After the battle Cynthia thinks we can help her with the investigation, so talk to her and accept her Quest. The first assignment has to do with the Lake Guardians, Cynthia is aware of Azluf Town and the lore over there about the Guardians. She suggests we head over and search around.

Back in Azluf Town, go and inspect the statue of the Guardians on the southwest side of town. We'll then receive a message from Cynthia, saying there have been reports of Pokemon similar to the Guardians making their way to a small isle. She has transferred a Myth Ticket to our Item Storage and now we must find a Sailor at Dis Bay who can take us to the small isle. No problem, we know who that Sailor is. Withdraw the ticket from Storage, go to Dis Bay, speak to the west dock Sailor and sail on.

There they are just up ahead, the Lake Guardians. A 4th square is above them with a stone plate that has this message:

"Guardians of the lake...Shapers of the human mind...Willpower, Emotion, Knowledge. Control all 3 to summon it..."

Excellent way to conclude our short time here (because once we return to the mainland we cannot come back to Myth Island). Return to Cynthia and show her the data. The Quest is completed and she gives us the Azure Flute for helping her. Wow, that is quite the reward. Great timing too because that's what will get us the final Mythical Pokemon.

Done and done. There you have it, NOW we've reached the end of our adventure. The only Quest which I left unfinished is Prof. Ivo's "PokeDex!" Quest, because trying to complete a PokeDex of 7 generations of Pokemon isn't exactly exciting for an old school fan like me haha. I will leave that task to those of you who enjoy completing their PokeDexes :) as for the rest of you, let's put the finishing touches on this walkthrough by jumping into the final section. 

[xzx] FINAL SECTION AND OTHER RAMBLINGS
=======================================

Many thanks to Vytron and everyone who worked on this game. Someday when there's documentation for Pokemon Saiph 1 and 2, I would be happy to make walkthroughs for them. What did you think of Pokemon Sors after everything has been said and done? Good? Bad? Somewhere in the middle? 

++POSITIVES++
- The Eclipse Tournament as an alternative to the Pokemon Gym system. Even after 8 generations of Pokemon I still don't mind the Pokemon Gym system but if game creators can provide something different and interesting, that is most welcome. The tournament allowed for more story development and players didn't have to worry about usual situations like having to earn specific Gym Badges in order to use specific HMs to move forward in the game...because there's no Gym :)
- Story-driven game. You could pack your game with all 8 generations of Pokemon and have modern mechanics and features, but for me it's not enough without a good story and a world to explore. Sors had a story to tell from the very beginning and it was fun to follow. 
- The HuPhone. Very cool device that had the World Map, access to the PC Item Storage, Soaring and the Quest Log. If it had access to the Pokemon Storage Boxes that would've been a double thumbs up from me since that is a current generation feature. 
- Alternatives to HMs. Except for Flash, Cut, Rock Climb and Defog, I usually don't mind HMs are in a game if they don't require Gym Badges, if they can be replaced by new moves and because HMs like Surf, Rock Smash, Strength and Waterfall are fine battle moves. Otherwise I like to see HM alternatives that are in the form of Key Items such as the ones in this game. 

--NEGATIVES--
- Many of the Pokemon have had their regular Abilities replaced and don't learn some moves which they normally do. Even the Move Tutors don't offer those moves. Abilities such as Trace and Frisk, moves such as Covet and Thief are missing from the game. I rely on these when I want to get information about Pokemon Abilities and Hold Items during major battles. Knock Off is in the game but cannot be learned by player's Pokemon, yet opponent Trainers can have Pokemon that know it. I hope this wasn't the case in Saiph 1 and/or is being carried over into that Pokemon Saiph sequel.
- HM Moves cannot be forgotten unless you speak to the Move Deleter (or if you have an Editor program which enables HMs to be deletable). I found out about this when I tried to teach a new move to a Pokemon which knew Rock Smash. 
- You can only do one Quest at a time. If any of you have played Pokemon Unbound then you understand how frustrating that is. You either have to complete the current Quest or cancel it until you can come back for it later because there's a chance you'll meet someone else who has a Quest soon. In Unbound you can have multiple active Missions, which come with a brief description and a general location of where that Mission is. Sadly the Quests in Sors have neither of those, you would have to be someone who doesn't mind exploring and backtracking through the region in order to find NPCs who have Quests to give. 
- Post-game content was rather disappointing. When Micah asked Asher to help him with the Team Void investigation in Colen I was looking forward to travelling to the region from the previous game and seeing how things have changed 3 years after the events of Saiph. But the investigation ended super quick after a major false alarm and we don't get to explore the whole Colen region, just a handful of places with not much going on in them. 

That's my feedback for the game, overall it was somewhere in the middle for me. What about for you? Please send all your feedback for Sors to Vytron and his team wherever you can contact them, whether it's in the Sors thread at the Pokemon Community forums site or on the Sors Discord server. That could encourage them to keep going and motivate them.

If you are a ROMhacker or know a ROMhacker who requires a walkthrough for their game please provide me with all the documentation for the game first, I will need that in order to make the walkthrough detailed.

The support is mostly to help me cover for my internet data and that allows me to continue providing guides, check online for information if I get stuck and so on. None of my walkthroughs are behind any paywall so if you are unable to support me, no worries, they will still be there for you to access.

HOUSE OF SOUNDS: This is the first of 3 music set series that I've been making since June 2019. In this series I play house tunes from my collection which I've had since my high school days. Mainly South African house music but there's room for international jams too. Old and new. If you're a fellow fan who loves to move and groove or just bop your head in time with the beats, I hope you'll check out this series :)

COUNTING ELECTRIC SHEEP: The second music set series, started just after House of Sounds. This one features anime and video game music. Opening themes, ending themes, songs from official soundtracks etc. If you like games, anime and manga as much as I do then this might be the series for you.

TUNING FOR TOONS: My third series, started in October 2020. This one will cater more to those of my generation (people born in the mid 1980s up to the mid 1990s), it features themes from classic cartoons that were a highlight of our much younger days. I've also thrown in parody commercials from the Grand Theft Auto games and shows like Sheep in the Big City. I recommend listening to each set without looking at the tracklist until the end :) test yourself and find out how many themes you can still recognise (and maybe still sing along to!)

COMICBOOK CHRONICLES: This will be a collection of comicbook and manga-related audio series. It began in August 2021 with Episode 1 of Asterix and the Indomitable Audio Series, a bimonthly offering in which I'll take a look at each volume of Asterix. From the plot to any commentary or bits of trivia related to a volume and if there is any feedback from you (send it here asterixaudioseries@xmail.net), we'll open the mail bag for that too.

POKEMON - THE JOURNEY OF JANICE: This was an idea I had in early 2019 which I had hoped to turn into a story for a ROMhack someday. I shared the idea around to see if anyone would be interested in teaming up with me to create the game. Months went by, there were people who liked the idea but I didn't hear from anyone who actually wanted to work with me. So I decided to spin out a story from the idea and post it chapter by chapter in the FanFiction section at the PokeCommunity site. That version of the story is a rework of the original form, which looks one of my walkthroughs :) I'll put a link to that original below if you're interested in seeing it but I'll encourage you to follow the reworked version because I'll be changing stuff there. An audio version of JoJ is also available now, I started putting it out a few months ago as a way for people who are new to the story to catch up and for returning fans to get a cool refresh and pick from where they left off. Apologies in advance for the quality, I'm currently recording each chapter on my not-so-smartphone but the audio version will include a variety of themes from the games (official games and any cool soundtracks from hacks and fan-made games) to add some colour to the story so I think you'll enjoy that.

Thank you for giving the walkthrough a try, I hope it helped and in some cases entertained you as well. This is my last walkthrough for 2021, we're in November now and I wouldn't want to spend the holidays busy with another guide, especially for one of the major games. I'll save the next walkthrough for the new year when I'm recharged and ready :) Covid or no Covid haha. Enjoy your holidays, hope for a much better year (2021 was the 2020 sequel nobody wanted) and take care out there. Please look forward to my next walkthrough. Cheers for now!
